# Log: Protobuf Data Dictionary Refactoring

**Date:** 2025-09-28

## 1. Summary

This log documents a series of refactoring operations on the project's protobuf schemas. The primary goal was to centralize common, reusable data types into the `proto/wayplatform/connect/tachograph/datadictionary/v1/` package.

This effort removes duplication, improves schema modularity and type safety, and more closely aligns the schemas with the official EU tachograph data dictionary. The changes detailed below are a prerequisite for updating the Go unmarshalling and marshalling code.

## 2. Refactoring Details

The following changes were made:

### 2.1. `ActivityChangeInfo` Centralization

-   **Problem**: The message representing a driver's activity change (`ActivityChangeInfo`, DD 2.1) was duplicated as a nested message in both `card/v1/driver_activity_data.proto` and `vu/v1/activities.proto`.
-   **Fix**:
    1.  A new canonical message, `ActivityChangeInfo`, was created in `proto/wayplatform/connect/tachograph/datadictionary/v1/activity_change_info.proto`.
    2.  Both `driver_activity_data.proto` and `activities.proto` were refactored to remove their local definitions and import the new shared message.
-   **Go Migration Guide**:
    -   Code that previously referenced `cardv1.DriverActivityData_DailyRecord_ActivityChange` or `vuv1.Activities_ActivityChange` must be updated to use `datadictionaryv1.ActivityChangeInfo`.

### 2.2. `CardStructureVersion` Centralization

-   **Problem**: The message for `CardStructureVersion` (DD 2.36) was duplicated as a nested message in `card/v1/application_identification.proto` and `vu/v1/technical_data.proto`.
-   **Fix**:
    1.  A new canonical message, `CardStructureVersion`, was created in `proto/wayplatform/connect/tachograph/datadictionary/v1/card_structure_version.proto`.
    2.  Both `application_identification.proto` and `technical_data.proto` were updated to use the new shared message.
-   **Go Migration Guide**:
    -   Code that previously referenced `cardv1.ApplicationIdentification_CardStructureVersion` or `vuv1.TechnicalData_CardRecord_CardStructureVersion` must be updated to use `datadictionaryv1.CardStructureVersion`.

### 2.3. `SoftwareIdentification` Extraction

-   **Problem**: The `VuSoftwareIdentification` message (DD 2.225) was nested within the large `technical_data.proto` schema, reducing modularity.
-   **Fix**:
    1.  The message was extracted to a new file: `proto/wayplatform/connect/tachograph/datadictionary/v1/software_identification.proto`.
    2.  It was renamed to the more generic `SoftwareIdentification`.
    3.  `vu/v1/technical_data.proto` was updated to import and use this new message.
-   **Go Migration Guide**:
    -   Code that previously referenced the nested type `vuv1.TechnicalData_VuIdentification_VuSoftwareIdentification` must be updated to use `datadictionaryv1.SoftwareIdentification`.

### 2.4. `Overview` Sub-types Extraction

-   **Problem**: The large `vu/v1/overview.proto` schema contained definitions for `DownloadablePeriod` (DD 2.193) and `SlotCardType` (derived from DD 2.34), which are generic data dictionary concepts.
-   **Fix**:
    1.  `DownloadablePeriod` was extracted to `proto/wayplatform/connect/tachograph/datadictionary/v1/downloadable_period.proto`.
    2.  `SlotCardType` was extracted to `proto/wayplatform/connect/tachograph/datadictionary/v1/slot_card_type.proto`, with improved documentation and protocol annotations. The enum values were also renamed for clarity (e.g., `DRIVER_CARD_INSERTED`).
    3.  `vu/v1/overview.proto` was updated to import and use these new types.
-   **Go Migration Guide**:
    -   Code that previously referenced `vuv1.Overview_DownloadablePeriod` must be updated to use `datadictionaryv1.DownloadablePeriod`.
    -   Code that previously referenced the `vuv1.Overview_SlotCardType` enum must be updated to use `datadictionaryv1.SlotCardType` and its new value names.

## 3. Conclusion

These refactoring steps have significantly improved the structure and consistency of the protobuf schemas. By centralizing duplicated and reusable types, we have created a more maintainable foundation for the Go codebase. The next step is to regenerate the protobuf Go files and update the application code to align with these new, canonical types.
