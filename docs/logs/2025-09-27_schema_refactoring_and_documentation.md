# Log: Comprehensive Protobuf Schema Refactoring and Documentation

**Date:** 2025-09-27

## 1. Summary

This log entry summarizes a major initiative to refactor and document the project's core protobuf schemas located in `proto/wayplatform/connect/tachograph/`. The primary goals were to improve schema accuracy, align naming with official regulations, and embed comprehensive documentation directly within the `.proto` files.

This work serves as a critical prerequisite for the upcoming refactoring of the Go unmarshalling and marshalling code, as the schemas now more accurately represent the underlying data structures.

## 2. Key Changes and Decisions

The refactoring was performed in several distinct phases across both the `card/v1` and `vu/v1` packages.

### 2.1. Structural Cleanup (`card/v1`)

*   **Problem**: The `card/v1` package contained many top-level messages that were only used as subtypes within other messages, cluttering the package namespace.
*   **Decision**: Subtypes were nested within their parent messages.
*   **Action**: `CardIdentification`, `DriverCardHolderIdentification`, `WorkshopCardHolderIdentification`, `ControlCardHolderIdentification`, and `CompanyCardHolderIdentification` were all moved into `identification.proto` as nested messages. The original source files were deleted.

### 2.2. Naming Alignment

*   **Problem**: Many message names were semantic but did not align directly with the Elementary File (EF) names from the regulation (e.g., `ChipIdentification` instead of `Ic` for `EF_IC`).
*   **Decision**: To improve clarity and make the relationship between the schema and the regulation explicit, message and file names were updated to match the official EF names as closely as possible.
*   **Action**: Renamed several messages, including `IccIdentification` -> `Icc`, `ChipIdentification` -> `Ic`, `LastCardDownload` -> `CardDownloadDriver`, and fixed several pluralization inconsistencies.

### 2.3. Modeling Inconsistencies

*   **Problem**: The new documentation effort revealed that many fields modeled as primitives (`string`, `bytes`) were actually structured `SEQUENCE`s in the ASN.1 specification (e.g., `FullCardNumber`, `ExtendedSerialNumber`).
*   **Decision**: To improve type safety and model accuracy, these flattened structures were refactored into proper, reusable messages. Per our principle, types used across multiple EFs/TREPs were moved to `datadictionary/v1`, while single-use types were nested.
*   **Action**:
    *   Created `FullCardNumber`, `ExtendedSerialNumber`, and `VehicleRegistrationIdentification` messages in `datadictionary/v1`.
    *   Created nested messages for `EmbedderIcAssemblerId` (in `Icc`) and `PreviousVehicleInfo` (in `Activities`).
    *   Refactored over a dozen files in `card/v1` and `vu/v1` to use these new structured messages.

### 2.4. Simplification of Enums

*   **Problem**: Several enums were being used to model simple binary choices (e.g., `yes(1)/no(0)`).
*   **Decision**: Where appropriate, these enums were replaced with the more idiomatic `bool` type.
*   **Action**:
    *   Refactored `ManualInputFlag` to a `bool manual_input_flag`.
    *   Refactored `CardStatus` to a `bool inserted`.
    *   Kept `DrivingStatus` and `CardSlotNumber` as enums, as the named values provide essential semantic clarity.

### 2.5. Removal of Unnecessary Fields

*   **Problem**: The schemas contained `unrecognized_` fields for every enum to preserve unknown values for round-tripping.
*   **Decision**: The tachograph specification is mature and stable. An unknown enum value should be treated as a parsing error, not preserved. This simplifies the schema and enforces stricter compliance.
*   **Action**: Removed all `unrecognized_` fields from all message definitions.

### 2.6. Comprehensive Documentation

*   **Problem**: The schemas lacked detailed, embedded documentation linking them to the official regulations.
*   **Decision**: Every message and field should be documented with its corresponding ASN.1 specification and a description of its purpose.
*   **Action**:
    *   Annotated every message with the EF or Transfer structure it represents, using ASCII trees to show the sequence of data elements for each generation.
    *   Annotated every field with a description and its specific, inlined ASN.1 data type definition from the Data Dictionary.
    *   Added special comments for discriminator fields (`generation`, `version`).

## 3. Conclusion and Next Steps

This comprehensive refactoring has resulted in a protobuf schema that is significantly more accurate, robust, and self-documenting. The next phase of work will be to update the Go marshalling and unmarshalling code (`unmarshal_*.go`, `append_*.go`) to align with these improved schemas. The detailed documentation and corrected message structures will serve as an invaluable guide for that effort.
