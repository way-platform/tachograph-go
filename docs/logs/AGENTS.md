# AGENTS.md: Development Logs

This directory contains logs of development progress.

The purpose is to provide context to other developers on how the project has
been developed, and to help us understand the decisions that have been made.

## File Naming Convention

To maintain a consistent and chronological order of log files, please adhere to the following naming convention.

### Principles

-   **Chronological:** File names should start with the date and time of the log entry.
-   **Readable:** A short, descriptive title should follow the timestamp.
-   **Consistent:** Use kebab-case for the entire filename.

### Format

Filenames should be in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-short-description.md`.

### Example

`2025-09-28T10-30-add-user-authentication.md`
