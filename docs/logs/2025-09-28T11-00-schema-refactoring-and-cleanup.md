# Log: Schema Refactoring and Cleanup - 2025-09-28

This document summarizes the significant schema changes made during a review session and outlines the necessary refactoring tasks for the Go codebase to adapt to these changes.

The primary goals of this effort were to improve semantic fidelity with the ASN.1 specification, enhance type safety, and ensure consistency across the Protobuf schema.

## Schema Changes Summary

1.  **`AGENTS.md` Updated**: The design principles document was updated to clarify the usage of `StringValue` for `IA5String` types and to add a new principle regarding the use of `bytes` for `OCTET STRING` to maintain semantic fidelity.

2.  **`BcdString` Message Created**: A new reusable message type, `BcdString`, was created in `datadictionary/v1` to correctly represent BCD-encoded numeric values. This message provides both the raw `encoded` bytes for fidelity and a `decoded` integer for usability.

3.  **`HolderName` Message Created**: A new `HolderName` message was created in `datadictionary/v1` to correctly model the structured `SEQUENCE { surname, firstnames }` data type, replacing previous simplified string representations.

4.  **`Driver/OwnerIdentification` Refactored**: The `DriverIdentification` and `OwnerIdentification` messages were corrected to match the ASN.1 specification (moving index fields to `OwnerIdentification`) and centralized into the `datadictionary/v1` package for reuse. Local definitions were removed from `identification.proto` and `full_card_number.proto`.

5.  **Type Corrections**: Numerous fields across multiple files were updated to use more appropriate types based on the project's design principles:
    - Fields representing `IA5String` were changed from `string` to `StringValue` (in `calibration.proto`, `overview.proto`, `driving_licence_info.proto`, etc.).
    - Fields representing `NationNumeric` were changed from `int32` to the `NationNumeric` enum (in `border_crossings.proto`, `calibration_add_data.proto`, etc.).
    - Fields representing single-byte `OCTET STRING` identifiers (`device_id`, `region`) were changed from `int32` to `bytes`.
    - The `activity_daily_presence_counter` and `vu_data_block_counter` fields were changed to use the new `BcdString` message.

## Development Refactoring Tasks

The following breaking changes require updates to the Go unmarshalling and processing logic.

1.  **Regenerate Protobuf Code**:

    - Run `buf generate` (or the project's equivalent) to compile the schemas and generate the new Go types.

2.  **Implement `BcdString` Logic**:

    - **Task**: Update unmarshalling code for `CardActivityDailyRecord` and `CardVehicleRecord`.
    - **Details**: When parsing `activity_daily_presence_counter` and `vu_data_block_counter`, the logic must now populate the `BcdString` message. Set the `encoded` field with the raw BCD bytes from the source file and the `decoded` field with the parsed integer value.
    - **Impact**: All consumer code that previously read these fields as integers must be updated to access the `.GetDecoded()` method (or similar, depending on the generated API).

3.  **Implement `HolderName` Logic**:

    - **Task**: Update unmarshalling code for `VuCardIWRecord` in `unmarshal_vu_activities.go`.
    - **Details**: The logic that previously created a simplified `card_holder_name` string must now parse the distinct surname and first names, populate two `StringValue` messages, and set them in the `holder_surname` and `holder_first_names` fields of the new `HolderName` message.
    - **Impact**: Consumers must now access the structured `card_holder_name` field (e.g., `.GetCardHolderName().GetHolderSurname().GetDecoded()`).

4.  **Adapt to `Driver/OwnerIdentification` Refactoring**:

    - **Task**: Review and update the unmarshalling logic for `CardNumber` and `FullCardNumber`.
    - **Details**: The logic must now correctly populate the `OwnerIdentification` message, including its `consecutive_index`, `replacement_index`, and `renewal_index` fields. Ensure that `DriverIdentification` is populated correctly without these fields.

5.  **Update `StringValue` Usage**:

    - **Task**: Find all compilation errors where a `string` is now a `*StringValue` message.
    - **Details**: In all affected unmarshallers (e.g., `unmarshal_vu_overview.go`, `unmarshal_card_calibration.go`), the logic must now instantiate and populate a `StringValue` message instead of a Go `string`.

6.  **Update Enum Usage**:

    - **Task**: Find all compilation errors where an `int32` is now a `NationNumeric` enum.
    - **Details**: The unmarshalling logic must map the raw integer from the source data to the corresponding generated Go enum constant for `NationNumeric`.

7.  **Update `bytes` Usage**:
    - **Task**: Find all compilation errors where an `int32` is now `[]byte`.
    - **Details**: For fields like `device_id` and `region`, the unmarshalling logic should now store the raw byte(s) directly, rather than interpreting them as an integer.
