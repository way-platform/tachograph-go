<h1>Appendix 10: SECURITY REQUIREMENTS</h1>

<p>This appendix specifies the IT security requirements for the smart tachograph system components (second-generation tachograph).</p>
<p>SEC_001 The following components of the smart tachograph system shall be security certified according to the Common Criteria scheme:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>vehicle unit</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>tachograph card,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>motion sensor,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>external GNSS facility.</dd></dl>



<p>SEC_002 The minimum IT security requirements to be met by each component needing to be security certified shall be defined in a component Protection Profile, according to the Common Criteria scheme.</p>
<p>SEC_003 The European Commission shall make sure that four Protection Profiles compliant with this Annex are sponsored, developed, approved by the governmental IT security certification bodies organised within the Joint Interpretation Working Group (JIWG) which is supporting the mutual recognition of certificates under the umbrella of the European SOGIS-MRA (Agreement on Mutual Recognition of Information Technology Security Evaluation Certificates) and registered:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>Protection Profile for vehicle unit,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>Protection Profile for tachograph card,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>Protection Profile for motion sensor,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>Protection Profile for external GNSS facility.</dd></dl>



<p>The Protection Profile for vehicle unit shall address the cases when the VU is designed to be used or not with an external GNSS facility. In the former case, the security requirements of the external GNSS facility are provided in the dedicated Protection Profile.</p>
<p>SEC_004 Component manufacturers shall refine and complete the appropriate component Protection Profile as necessary, without amending or deleting existing threats, objectives, procedural means and security enforcing functions specifications, in order to build a Security Target against which they shall seek the security certification of the component.</p>
<p>SEC_005 Strict conformance of such specific Security Target with the corresponding Protection Profile must be stated during the evaluation process.</p>
<p>SEC_006 The assurance level for each Protection Profile shall be EAL4 augmented by the assurance components ATE_DPT.2 and AVA_VAN.5.</p>
