<p>2.   <strong>BASIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GNSS RECEIVER</strong>
            </p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>Regardless of the configuration of the Smart Tachograph with or without an external GNSS facility, the provision of accurate and reliable positioning information is an essential element of the effective operation of the Smart Tachograph. Therefore, it is appropriate to require its compatibility with the services provided by the Galileo and European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) programmes as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1285/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (<a href="#E0020" id="src.E0020">
                  <sup>13</sup>
               </a>). The system established under the Galileo programme is an independent global satellite navigation system and the one established under the EGNOS programme is a regional satellite navigation system improving the quality of the Global Positioning System signal.</p>
<p>GNS_2 Manufacturers shall ensure that the GNSS receivers in the Smart Tachographs are compatible with the positioning services provided by the Galileo and the EGNOS systems. Manufacturers may also choose, in addition, compatibility with other satellite navigation systems.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_3 The GNSS receiver shall have the capability to support Navigation Messages Authentication on the Open Service of Galileo (OSNMA).</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_3a The GNSS receiver shall perform a number of consistency checks in order to verify that the measurements computed by the GNSS receiver on the basis of the OSNMA data have resulted in the correct information about the position, velocity and data of the vehicle, and have therefore not been influenced by any external attack such as meaconing. These consistency checks shall consist, for instance, of:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>detection of abnormal power emissions by means of combined monitoring of the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and Carrier-to-Noise density ratio (C/N0),</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>pseudorange measurement consistency and Doppler measurement consistency over time, including the detection of abrupt measurement jumps,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) techniques, including the detection of inconsistent measurements with the estimated position,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>position and velocity checks, including abnormal position and velocity solutions, sudden jumps and behaviour not consistent with the dynamics of the vehicle,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>time and frequency consistency, including clock jumps and drifts that are not consistent with the receiver clock characteristics.</dd></dl>




<p>GNS_3b The European Commission shall develop and approve the following documents:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>A Signal in Space Interface Control Document (SIS ICD), specifying in detail the OSNMA information transmitted in the Galileo signal.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>OSNMA Receiver Guidelines, providing the requirements and processes in the receivers to guarantee a secure implementation of OSNMA, as well as recommendations to enhance OSNMA performance.</dd></dl>

<p>GNSS receivers fitted in tachographs, either internal or external, shall be constructed in accordance with the SIS ICD and the OSNMA receiver guidelines.</p>
<p>GNS_3c The GNSS receiver shall provide position messages, called authenticated position messages in this Annex and its Appendixes, which are elaborated using only satellites from which the authenticity of the navigation messages has been successfully verified.</p>
<p>GNS_3d The GNSS receiver shall also provide standard position messages, elaborated using the satellites in view, regardless whether they are authenticated or not.</p>
<p>GNS_3e The GNSS receiver shall use the VU Real Time Clock (RTC) as time reference for the time synchronisation necessary for OSNMA.</p>
<p>GNS_3f The VU RTC time shall be provided to the GNSS receiver by the VU.</p>
<p>GNS_3g The maximal time drift specified in requirement 41 of Annex IC, shall be provided to the GNSS receiver by the VU, along with the VU RTC time.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>3.   <strong>SENTENCES PROVIDED BY THE GNSS RECEIVER</strong>
            </p>
<p>This section describes the sentences used in the functioning of the Smart Tachograph, for transmitting standard and authenticated position messages. This section is valid both for the configuration of the Smart Tachograph with or without an external GNSS facility.</p>

            </p>
<p>GNS_13 The external GNSS facility shall store the following values in the non-volatile memory of the GNSS Secure Transceiver when it leaves the factory:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>the EGF_MA key pair and corresponding certificate,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the MSCA_VU-EGF certificate containing the MSCA_VU-EGF.PK public key to be used for verification of the EGF_MA certificate,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the EUR certificate containing the EUR.PK public key to be used for verification of the MSCA_VU-EGF certificate,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the EUR certificate whose validity period directly precedes the validity period of the EUR certificate to be used to verify the MSCA_VU-EGF certificate, if existing,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the link certificate linking these two EUR certificates, if existing,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the extended serial-number of the external GNSS facility,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>operating system identifier of the GNSS facility,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>type approval number of the external GNSS facility;</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>Identifier of the security component of the external GNSS module.</dd></dl>








<p>4.2.   <strong>Communication between the external GNSS facility and the vehicle unit</strong>
            </p>
<p>4.2.1   <strong>Communication Protocol</strong>
            </p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_14 The communication protocol between the external GNSS facility and the vehicle unit shall support the following functions:</p>
<dl><dt>1.</dt><dd>The collection and distribution of GNSS data (e.g., position, timing, speed),</dd><dt>2.</dt><dd>The collection of the configuration data of the external GNSS facility,</dd><dt>3.</dt><dd>The management protocol to support the coupling, mutual authentication and session key agreement between the external GNSS facility and the VU,</dd><dt>4.</dt><dd>The transmission to the external GNSS facility of the VU RTC time and of the maximal difference between true time and the VU RTC time.</dd></dl>



<p>▼B</p>
<p>GNS_15 The communication protocol shall be based on standard ISO/IEC 7816-4:2013 with the VU Secure Transceiver playing the master role and the GNSS Secure Transceiver playing the slave role. The physical connection between the external GNSS facility and the vehicule unit is based on ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 or another standard able to support ISO/IEC 7816-4:2013</p>
<p>▼M1</p>
<p>GNS_16 In the communication protocol, extended length fields shall not be supported.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>GNS_17 The communication protocol of ISO 7816 (both *-4:2013 and *-12:2005) between the external GNSS facility and the VU shall be set to T = 1.</p>
<p>▼M1</p>
<p>GNS_18 Regarding the functions 1) the collection and distribution of GNSS data and 2) the collection of the configuration data of the external GNSS facility and 3) management protocol, the GNSS Secure Transceiver shall simulate a smart card with a file system architecture composed by a Master File (MF), a Dedicated File (DF) with Application Identifier specified in Appendix 1 chapter 6.2 (‘FF 44 54 45 47 4D’) and with 3 EFs containing certificates and one single Elementary File (EF.EGF) with file identifier equal to ‘2F2F’ as described in Table 1.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_18a Regarding the function 4) the transmission to the external GNSS facility of the VU RTC time and of the maximal difference between true time and the VU RTC time, the GNSS Secure Transceiver shall use an EF (EF VU) in the same DF with file identifier equal to ‘2F30’ as described in Table 1.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>GNS_19 The GNSS Secure Transceiver shall store the data coming from the GNSS receiver and the configuration in the EF.EGF. This is a linear, variable-length record file with an identifier equal to ‘2F2F’ in hexadecimal format.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_19a The GNSS Secure Transceiver shall store the data coming from the VU in the EF VU. This is a linear, fixed-length record file with an identifier equal to ‘2F30’ in hexadecimal format.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_20 The GNSS Secure Transceiver shall use a memory to store the data and be able to perform as many read/write cycles as needed during a lifetime of at least 15 years. Apart from this aspect, the internal design and implementation of the GNSS Secure Transceiver is left to the manufacturers.</p>
<p>▼M1</p>
<p>The mapping of record numbers and data is provided in Table 1. Note that there are five GSA sentences for the GNSS constellations and Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS).</p>

<p>GNS_22 The secure transfer of GNSS position data, VU RTC time and maximal time difference between true time and the VU RTC time shall be allowed only in the following conditions:</p>

<dl><dt>1.</dt><dd>The coupling process has been completed as described in Appendix 11. Common security mechanisms.</dd><dt>2.</dt><dd>The periodic mutual authentication and session key agreement between the VU and the external GNSS facility also described in Appendix 11. Common security mechanisms has been executed with the indicated frequency.</dd></dl>

<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_23 Every T seconds, where T is a value lower or equal to 20, unless coupling or mutual authentication and session key agreement takes place, the VU requests from the external GNSS facility the position information on the basis of the following flow:</p>
<dl><dt>1.</dt><dd>The VU requests position data from the External GNSS facility together with Dilution of Precision data (from the GSA and ASA sentences). The VU Secure Transceiver shall use the ISO/IEC 7816-4:2013 SELECT and READ RECORD(S) commands in secure messaging authentication-only mode as described in section 11.5 of Appendix 11 with the file identifier ‘2F2F’ and RECORD number equal to ‘01’ for RMC NMEA sentence, ‘02’,‘03’,‘04’,‘05’,‘06’ for GSA NMEA sentence, ‘11’ for AMC sentence, and ‘12’,‘13’,‘14’,‘15’,‘16’ for ASA sentence.</dd><dt>2.</dt><dd>The last position data received is stored in the EF with identifier ‘2F2F’ and the records described in Table 1 in the GNSS secure transceiver as the GNSS secure transceiver receives NMEA data with a frequency of at least 1 Hz from the GNSS receiver through the GNSS data interface.</dd><dt>3.</dt><dd>The GNSS Secure Transceiver sends the response to the VU Secure Transceiver by using the APDU response message in secure messaging authentication-only mode as described in section 11.5 of Appendix 11.</dd><dt>4.</dt><dd>The VU Secure Transceiver checks the authenticity and integrity of the received response. In case of positive outcome, the position data is transferred to the VU processor through the GNSS data interface.</dd><dt>5.</dt><dd>The VU processor checks the received data extracting the information (e.g., latitude, longitude, time) from the RMC NMEA sentence. The RMC NMEA sentence includes the information if the non-authenticated position is valid. If the non-authenticated position is valid, the VU processor also extracts the values of HDOP from GSA NMEA sentences and calculates the minimum value on the available satellite systems (i.e., when the fix is available).</dd><dt>6.</dt><dd>The VU processor also extracts the information (e.g., latitude, longitude, time) from the AMC sentence. The AMC sentence includes the information if the authenticated position is not valid or GNSS signal has been attacked. If the position is valid, the VU processor also extracts the values of HDOP from ASA sentences and calculates the minimum value on the available satellite systems (i.e., when the fix is available).</dd></dl>





<p>GNS_23a The VU shall also write VU RTC time and maximal time difference between true time and the VU RTC time as needed, by using the ISO/IEC 7816-4:2013 SELECT and WRITE RECORD(S) commands in secure messaging authentication-only mode as described in section 11.5 of Appendix 11 with the file identifier ‘2F30’ and RECORD number equal to ‘01’ for VuRtcTime and ‘02’ for MaximalTimeDifference.</p>

<p>4.3.   <strong>Coupling, mutual authentication and session key agreement of the external GNSS facility with vehicle unit</strong>
            </p>
<p>The coupling, mutual authentication and session key agreement of the external GNSS facility with the vehicle unit is described in Appendix 11. Common security mechanisms, Chapter 11.</p>
<p>4.4.   <strong>Error Handling</strong>
            </p>
<p>This section describes how potential error conditions by the external GNSS facility are addressed and recorded in the VU.</p>
<p>4.4.1   <strong>Communication error with the external GNSS facility</strong>
            </p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_28 A communication error with the external GNSS facility event shall be recorded in the VU, as defined in requirement 82 of Annex IC and Appendix 1 (EventFaultType). In this context, a communication error is triggered when the VU Secure Transceiver does not receive a response message after a request message as described in 4.2.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>4.4.2   <strong>Breach of the physical integrity of the external GNSS facility</strong>
            </p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_29 If the external GNSS facility has been breached, the GNSS Secure Transceiver shall ensure that cryptographic material is unavailable. As described in GNS_25 and GNS_26, the VU shall detect tampering if the Response has status ‘6690’. The VU shall then generate and record a security breach attempt event as defined in requirement 85 of Annex IC and Appendix 1 (EventFaultType for tamper detection of GNSS). Alternately, the external GNSS facility may respond to VU requests without secure messaging and with status ‘6A88’.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>4.4.3   <strong>Absence of position information from GNSS receiver</strong>
            </p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_30 If the GNSS Secure Transceiver does not receive data from the GNSS receiver, the GNSS Secure Transceiver shall generate a response message to the READ RECORD command with RECORD number equal to ‘01’ with a Data Field of 12 bytes all set to 0xFF. Upon reception of the Response message with this value of the data field, the VU shall generate and record an absence of position information from GNSS receiver event, as defined in requirement 81 of Annex IC and Appendix 1 (EventFaultType).</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>4.4.4   <strong>External GNSS facility certificate expired</strong>
            </p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_31 If the VU detects that the EGF certificate used for mutual authentication is not valid any longer, the VU shall generate and record a security breach attempt event as defined in requirement 85 of Annex IC and Appendix 1 (EventFaultType for external GNSS facility certificate expired). The VU shall still use the received GNSS position data.</p>

<p>5.1.   <strong>Configuration</strong>
            </p>
<p>In this configuration, the GNSS receiver is inside the Vehicle Unit as described in Figure 1.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>GNS_32 For transmitting position, DOP and satellites data, the GNSS receiver shall act as a talker and transmit NMEA or NMEA-like sentences to the VU processor, which shall act as a listener with a frequency of 1/10 Hz or faster for the pre-defined set of sentences, which shall include at least the RMC, GSA, AMC and ASA sentences. Alternatively, the VU processor and the internal GNSS receiver may use other data formats to exchange the data contained in the NMEA or NMEA-like sentences specified in GNS_4, GNS_4a and GNS_5.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>GNS_33 An external GNSS antenna installed on the vehicle or an internal GNSS antenna shall be connected to the VU.</p>
