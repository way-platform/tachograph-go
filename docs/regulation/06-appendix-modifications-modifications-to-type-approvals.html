<p class="norm">A ‘revision’ shall be made where the type-approval authority considers that the modifications in software or hardware of the tachograph or in the nature of materials used for its manufacture are minor. In such cases, the type-approval authority shall issue the revised documents of the information package, indicating the nature of the modifications made and the date of their approval. An updated version of the information package in a consolidated form, accompanied by a detailed description of the modifications made, shall be sufficient to meet this requirement.</p>
<p class="norm">An ‘extension’ shall be made where the type-approval authority considers that the modifications in software or hardware of the tachograph or in the nature of materials used for its manufacture are substantial. In such cases, it may request that new tests be conducted and inform the manufacturer or its agent accordingly. If those tests prove satisfactory, the type-approval authority shall issue a revised type-approval certificate containing a number referring to the extension granted. The type-approval certificate shall mention the reason of the extension and its date of issue.</p>
