<h1>Article 5: Modifications to type-approvals</h1>

<div>
                  <span>1.</span>
                  The manufacturer or its agent shall inform without delay the type-approval authorities that granted the original type-approval, about any modification in software or hardware of the tachograph or in the nature of the materials used for its manufacture which are recorded in the information package and shall submit an application for the modification of the type-approval.
               </div>
<div>
                  <span>2.</span>
                  The type-approval authorities may revise or extend an existing type-approval, or issue a new type-approval according to the nature and characteristics of the modifications.
               </div>
<p>A ‘revision’ shall be made where the type-approval authority considers that the modifications in software or hardware of the tachograph or in the nature of materials used for its manufacture are minor. In such cases, the type-approval authority shall issue the revised documents of the information package, indicating the nature of the modifications made and the date of their approval. An updated version of the information package in a consolidated form, accompanied by a detailed description of the modifications made, shall be sufficient to meet this requirement.</p>
<p>An ‘extension’ shall be made where the type-approval authority considers that the modifications in software or hardware of the tachograph or in the nature of materials used for its manufacture are substantial. In such cases, it may request that new tests be conducted and inform the manufacturer or its agent accordingly. If those tests prove satisfactory, the type-approval authority shall issue a revised type-approval certificate containing a number referring to the extension granted. The type-approval certificate shall mention the reason of the extension and its date of issue.</p>
<div>
                  <span>3.</span>
                  The index to the information package shall indicate the date of the most recent extension or revision of the type-approval, or the date of the most recent consolidation of the updated version of the type-approval.
               </div>
<div>
                  <span>4.</span>
                  A new type-approval shall be necessary when the requested modifications to the type-approved tachograph or its components would lead to the issuance of a new security or interoperability certificate.
               </div>
