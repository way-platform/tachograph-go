<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This Annex contains second generation recording equipment and tachograph cards requirements.</p>
<p>Since June 15<sup>th</sup> 2019, second generation recording equipment is being installed in vehicles registered in the Union for the first time, and second generation tachograph cards are being issued.</p>
<p>In order to smoothly implement the second generation tachograph system, second generation tachograph cards have been designed to be also used in first generation vehicle units built in accordance with Annex IB to Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85.</p>
<p>Reciprocally, first generation tachograph cards may be used in second generation vehicle units. Nevertheless, second generation vehicle units can only be calibrated using second generation workshop cards.</p>
<p>The requirements regarding the interoperability between the first and the second generation tachograph systems are specified in this Annex. In this respect, Appendix 15 contains additional details on the management of the co-existence of both generations.</p>
<p>In addition, due to the implementation of new functions such as the use of Galileo Open Signal Navigation Messages Authentication, detection of border crossings, entry of load and unload operations, and also to the need to increase the driver card capacity to 56 days of driver activities, this Regulation introduces the technical requirements for the second version of the second generation recording equipment and tachograph cards.</p>

               <p>The computations involved take into account, as needed, past activities stored on the driver card. Unknown periods of negative duration (start of unknown period &gt; end of unknown period) due to time overlaps between two different sets of recording equipment, are not taken into account for the computation.</p>
               <p>When the driver has not inserted his card, the computations involved are based on the data memory recordings related to the current period where no card was inserted and related to the relevant slot;</p>

<p>3.   <strong>CONSTRUCTION AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR RECORDING EQUIPMENT</strong>
         </p>
<p>3.1   <strong>Monitoring cards insertion and withdrawal</strong>
         </p>
<p>(15) The recording equipment shall monitor the card interface devices to detect card insertions and withdrawals.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(16) Upon card insertion (or remote card authentication) the recording equipment shall detect whether the card is a valid tachograph card in accordance with definition (ee) in section 1, and in such a case identify the card type and the card generation.</p>
<p>For checking if a card has already been inserted, the recording equipment shall use the tachograph card data stored in its data memory, as set out in requirement 133.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(17) First generation tachograph cards shall be considered as non-valid by the recording equipment, after the possibility of using first generation tachograph cards has been suppressed by a workshop, in compliance with Appendix 15 (req. MIG003).</p>
<p>(18) First generation workshop cards which are inserted in the second generation recording equipment shall be considered as non-valid.</p>
<p>(19) The recording equipment shall be so designed that the tachograph cards are locked in position on their proper insertion into the card interface devices.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(20) The withdrawal of tachograph cards may function only when the vehicle is stopped and after the relevant data have been stored on the cards. The withdrawal of the card shall require positive action by the user.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>3.2   <strong>Speed, position and distance measurement</strong>
         </p>
<p>(21) The motion sensor (possibly embedded in the adaptor) is the main source for speed and distance measurement.</p>
<p>(22) This function shall continuously measure and be able to provide the odometer value corresponding to the total distance travelled by the vehicle using the pulses provided by the motion sensor.</p>
<p>(23) This function shall continuously measure and be able to provide the speed of the vehicle using the pulses provided by the motion sensor.</p>
<p>(24) The speed measurement function shall also provide the information whether the vehicle is moving or stopped. The vehicle shall be considered as moving as soon as the function detects more than 1 imp/sec for at least 5 seconds from the motion sensor, otherwise the vehicle shall be considered as stopped.</p>
<p>(25) Devices displaying speed (speedometer) and total distance travelled (odometer) installed in any vehicle fitted with a recording equipment complying with the provisions of this Regulation, shall comply with the requirements relating to maximum tolerances (see 3.2.1 and 3.2.2) laid down in this Annex.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(26) To detect manipulation of motion data, information from the motion sensor shall be corroborated by vehicle motion information derived from the GNSS receiver and by other source(s) independent from the motion sensor. At least another independent vehicle motion source shall be inside the VU without the need of an external interface.</p>
<p>(27) This function shall measure the position of the vehicle in order to allow for the recording of:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>positions where the driver and/or the co-driver begins his daily work period;</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>positions where the accumulated driving time reaches a multiple of three hours;</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>positions where the vehicle has crossed the border of a country;</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>positions where operations of load/unload have been carried out;</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>positions where the driver and/or the co-driver ends his daily work period.</dd></dl>




<p>▼B</p>
<p>3.2.1   <strong>Measurement of distance travelled</strong>
         </p>
<p>(28) The distance travelled may be measured either:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>so as to cumulate both forward and reverse movements, or</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>so as to include only forward movement.</dd></dl>

<p>(29) The recording equipment shall measure distance from 0 to 9 999 999,9  km.</p>
<p>(30) Distance measured shall be within the following tolerances (distances of at least 1 000  m.):</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>± 1 % before installation,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>± 2 % on installation and periodic inspection,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>± 4 % in use.</dd></dl>


<p>▼M3</p>
<p>The tolerances shall not be used to intentionally alter the distance measured.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(31) Distance measured shall have a resolution better than or equal to 0,1 km.</p>
<p>3.2.2   <strong>Measurement of speed</strong>
         </p>
<p>(32) The recording equipment shall measure speed from 0 to 220 km/h.</p>

<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>a ± 2 km/h tolerance for input variations (tyre variations, …),</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>a ± 1 km/h tolerance in measurements made during installation or periodic inspections,</dd></dl>

<p>the recording equipment shall, for speeds between 20 and 180 km/h, and for characteristic coefficients of the vehicle between 2 400 and 25 000 imp/km, measure the speed with a tolerance of ± 1 km/h (at constant speed).</p>
<p>Note: The resolution of data storage brings an additional tolerance of ± 0,5 km/h to speed stored by the recording equipment.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(34) The speed shall be measured correctly within the normal tolerances within 2 seconds of the end of a speed change when the speed has changed at a rate up to 2 m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>(35) Speed measurement shall have a resolution better than or equal to 1 km/h.</p>
<p>3.2.3   <strong>Measurement of position</strong>
         </p>
<p>(36) The recording equipment shall measure the absolute position of the vehicle using the GNSS receiver.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(37) The absolute position shall be measured in geographical coordinates of latitude and longitude in degrees and minutes with a resolution of 1/10 of a minute.</p>
<p>▼B</p>

         </p>
<p>(38) The time measurement function shall measure permanently and digitally provide UTC date and time.</p>
<p>(39) UTC date and time shall be used for dating data inside the recording equipment (recordings, data exchange) and for all printouts specified in Appendix 4 ‘Printouts’.</p>
<p>(40) In order to visualise the local time, it shall be possible to change the offset of the time displayed, in half hour steps. No other offsets than negative or positive multiples of half hours shall be allowed.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(41) Time drift shall be ± 1 second per day or less, in temperature conditions in accordance with requirement 213, in the absence of any time adjustment.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(41a) Time accuracy when time is adjusted by workshops in accordance with requirement 212 shall be 3 seconds or better.</p>
<p>(41b) The vehicle unit shall include a drift counter, which computes the maximal time drift since the last time adjustment in accordance with point 3.23. The maximal time drift shall be defined by the vehicle unit manufacturer and shall not exceed 1 second per day, as set out in requirement 41.</p>
<p>(41c) The drift counter shall be reset to 1 second after each time adjustment of the recording equipment in accordance with point 3.23. This includes:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>automatic time adjustments,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>time adjustments performed in calibration mode.</dd></dl>

<p>▼B</p>
<p>(42) Time measured shall have a resolution better than or equal to 1 second.</p>
<p>(43) Time measurement shall not be affected by an external power supply cut-off of less than 12 months in type approval conditions.</p>
<p>3.4   <strong>Monitoring driver activities</strong>
         </p>
<p>(44) This function shall permanently and separately monitor the activities of one driver and one co-driver.</p>
<p>(45) Driver activity shall be DRIVING, WORK, AVAILABILITY or BREAK/REST.</p>
<p>(46) It shall be possible for the driver and/or the co-driver to manually select WORK, AVAILABILITY or BREAK/REST.</p>
<p>(47) When the vehicle is moving, DRIVING shall be selected automatically for the driver and AVAILABILITY shall be selected automatically for the co-driver.</p>
<p>(48) When the vehicle stops, WORK shall be selected automatically for the driver.</p>
<p>▼M1</p>
<p>(49) The first change of activity to BREAK/REST or AVAILABILITY arising within 120 seconds of the automatic change to WORK due to the vehicle stop shall be assumed to have happened at the time of vehicle stop (therefore possibly cancelling the change to WORK).</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(50) This function shall output activity changes to the recording functions at a resolution of one minute.</p>
<p>(51) Given a calendar minute, if DRIVING is registered as the activity of both the immediately preceding and the immediately succeeding minute, the whole minute shall be regarded as DRIVING.</p>
<p>(52) Given a calendar minute that is not regarded as DRIVING according to requirement 051, the whole minute shall be regarded to be of the same type of activity as the longest continuous activity within the minute (or the latest of the equally long activities).</p>
<p>(53) This function shall also permanently monitor the continuous driving time and the cumulative break time of the driver.</p>
<p>3.5   <strong>Monitoring driving status</strong>
         </p>
<p>(54) This function shall permanently and automatically monitor the driving status.</p>
<p>(55) The driving status CREW shall be selected when two valid driver cards are inserted in the equipment, the driving status SINGLE shall be selected in any other case.</p>
<p>3.6   <strong>Driver&#39;s entries</strong>
         </p>
<p>3.6.1   <strong>Entry of places where daily work periods begin and/or end</strong>
         </p>
<p>(56) This function shall allow for the entry of places where, according to the driver and/or the co-driver, his daily work periods begin and/or end.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(57) Places are defined as the country and, in addition where applicable, the region.</p>
<p>(58) Upon driver (or workshop) card withdrawal, the recording equipment shall display the current place of the vehicle on the basis of the GNSS information, and of stored digital map in accordance with point 3.12.19, and shall request the cardholder to confirm or to manually rectify the place.</p>
<p>(59) The place entered in accordance with requirement 58 shall be considered as the place where the daily work period ends. It shall be recorded in the relevant driver (or workshop) card as a temporary record, and may therefore be later overwritten.</p>
<p>Under the following conditions temporary entry made at last card withdrawal is validated (i.e. shall not be overwritten anymore):</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>entry of a place where the current daily work period begins during manual entry according to requirement (61);</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the next entry of a place where the current daily work period begins if the card holder does not enter any place where the work period begins or ended during the manual entry according to requirement (61).</dd></dl>

<p>Under the following conditions temporary entry made at last card withdrawal is overwritten and the new value is validated:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>the next entry of a place where the current daily work period ends if the card holder does not enter any place where the work period begins or ended during the manual input according to requirement (61).</dd></dl>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(60) It shall be possible to input places where daily work periods begin and/or end through commands in the menus. If more than one such input is done within one calendar minute, only the last begin place input and the last end place input done within that time shall be kept recorded.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>The recording equipment shall display the current place of the vehicle on the basis of the GNSS information, and of stored digital map(s) in accordance with point 3.12.19 and shall request the driver to confirm or to manually rectify the place.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>3.6.2   <strong>Manual entry of driver activities and driver consent for ITS interface</strong>
         </p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(61) Upon driver (or workshop) card insertion, and only at this time, the recording equipment shall allow manual entries of activities. Manual entries of activities shall be performed using local time and date values of the time zone (UTC offset) currently set for the vehicle unit.</p>
<p>At driver or workshop card insertion the cardholder shall be reminded of:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>the date and time of his last card withdrawal;</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>optionally: the local time offset currently set for the vehicle unit.</dd></dl>

<p>At the first insertion of a given driver card or workshop card currently unknown to the vehicle unit, the cardholder shall be invited to express his consent for tachograph related personal data output through the ITS interface. For checking if a card has already been inserted, the recording equipment shall use the tachograph card data stored in its data memory, as set out in requirement 133.</p>
<p>At any moment, the driver (resp. workshop) consent can be enabled or disabled through commands in the menu, provided the driver (resp. workshop) card is inserted.</p>
<p>It shall be possible to input activities with the following restrictions:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>Activity type shall be WORK, AVAILABILITY or BREAK/REST;</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>Start and end times for each activity shall be within the period of the last card withdrawal – current insertion only;</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>Activities shall not be allowed to overlap mutually in time.</dd></dl>


<p>It shall be possible to make manual entries, if required, at the first insertion of a previously unused driver (or workshop) card.</p>
<p>The procedure for manual entries of activities shall include as many consecutive steps as necessary to set a type, a start time and an end time for each activity. For any part of the time period between last card withdrawal and current card insertion, the cardholder shall have the option not to declare any activity.</p>
<p>During the manual entries associated with card insertion and if applicable, the card holder shall have the opportunity to input:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>a place where a previous daily work period ended, associated to the relevant time (thus overwriting and validating the entry made at the last card withdrawal),</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>a place where the current daily work period begins, associated to the relevant time (thus validating a temporary entry made at last card withdrawal).</dd></dl>

<p>For the place where the current daily work period begins entered at the current card insertion, the recording equipment shall display the current place of the vehicle on the basis of the GNSS information, and of stored digital map(s) in accordance with point 3.12.19, and shall request the driver to confirm or to manually rectify the place.</p>
<p>If the card holder does not enter any place where the work period begins or ended, during the manual entries associated with card insertion, this shall be considered as a declaration that his work period has not changed since the last card withdrawal. The next entry of a place where a previous daily work period ends shall then overwrite the temporary entry made at the last card withdrawal.</p>
<p>If a place is entered, it shall be recorded in the relevant tachograph card.</p>
<p>Manual entries shall be interrupted if:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>the card is withdrawn or,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the vehicle is moving and the card is in the driver slot.</dd></dl>

<p>Additional interruptions are allowed, e.g. a timeout after a certain period of user inactivity. If manual entries are interrupted, the recording equipment shall validate any complete place and activity entries (having either unambiguous place and time, or activity type, begin time and end time) already made.</p>
<p>If a second driver or workshop card is inserted while manual entries of activities are in progress for a previously inserted card, the manual entries for this previous card shall be allowed to be completed before manual entries start for the second card.</p>
<p>The cardholder shall have the option to insert manual entries according to the following minimum procedure:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>Enter activities manually, in chronological order, for the period last card withdrawal – current insertion.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>Begin time of the first activity shall be set to card withdrawal time. For each subsequent entry, the start time shall be preset to immediately follow the end time of the previous entry. Activity type and end time shall be selected for each activity.</dd></dl>

<p>The procedure shall end when the end time of a manually entered activity equals the card insertion time.</p>
<p>The recording equipment shall allow drivers and workshops to alternately upload manual entries that need to be entered during the procedure through the ITS interface specified in Appendix 13 and, optionally, through other interfaces.</p>
<p>The recording equipment shall allow the card holder to modify any activity manually entered, until validation by selection of a specific command. Thereafter, any such modification shall be forbidden.</p>

<p>(63) This function shall allow the management of the locks placed by a company to restrict data access in company mode to itself.</p>
<p>(64) Company locks consist in a start date/time (lock-in) and an end date/time (lock-out) associated with the identification of the company as denoted by the company card number (at lock-in).</p>
<p>(65) Locks may be turned ‘in’ or ‘out’ in real time only.</p>
<p>(66) Locking-out shall only be possible for the company whose lock is ‘in’ (as identified by the first 13 digits of the company card number), or,</p>
<p>(67) Locking-out shall be automatic if another company locks in.</p>
<p>(68) In the case where a company locks in and where the previous lock was for the same company, then it will be assumed that the previous lock has not been turned ‘out’ and is still ‘in’.</p>
<p>3.8   <strong>Monitoring control activities</strong>
         </p>
<p>(69) This function shall monitor DISPLAYING, PRINTING, VU and card DOWNLOADING, and ROADSIDE CALIBRATION check activities carried while in control mode.</p>
<p>(70) This function shall also monitor OVER SPEEDING CONTROL activities while in control mode. An over speeding control is deemed to have happened when, in control mode, the ‘over speeding’ printout has been sent to the printer or to the display, or when ‘events and faults’ data have been downloaded from the VU data memory.</p>

<p>5.   <strong>INSTALLATION OF RECORDING EQUIPMENT</strong>
         </p>
<p>5.1   <strong>Installation</strong>
         </p>
<p>(381) New recording equipment shall be delivered non-activated to fitters or vehicle manufacturers, with all calibration parameters, as listed in Chapter 3.21, set to appropriate and valid default values. Where no particular value is appropriate, literal parameters shall be set to strings of ‘?’ and numeric parameters shall be set to ‘0’. Delivery of security relevant parts of the recording equipment can be restricted if required during security certification.</p>
<p>(382) Before its activation, the recording equipment shall give access to the calibration function even if not in calibration mode.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(383) Before its activation, the recording equipment shall neither record nor store data referred to by the requirements 102 to 133 inclusive. Nevertheless, before its activation, the recording equipment may record and store the security breach attempt events in accordance with requirement 117, and the recording equipment faults in accordance with requirement 118.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(384) During installation, vehicle manufacturers shall pre-set all known parameters.</p>
<p>(385) Vehicle manufacturers or fitters shall activate the installed recording equipment at the latest before the vehicle is used in scope of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006.</p>
<p>(386) The activation of the recording equipment shall be triggered automatically by the first insertion of a valid workshop card in either of its card interface devices.</p>
<p>(387) Specific pairing operations required between the motion sensor and the vehicle unit, if any, shall take place automatically before or during activation.</p>
<p>(388) In a similar way, specific coupling operations between the external GNSS facility and the vehicle unit, if any, shall take place automatically before or during activation.</p>
<p>(389) After its activation, the recording equipment shall fully enforce functions and data access rights.</p>
<p>(390) After its activation, the recording equipment shall communicate to the remote communication facility the secured data necessary for the purpose of targeted roadside checks.</p>
<p>(391) The recording and storing functions of the recording equipment shall be fully operational after its activation.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(392) Installation shall be followed by a calibration. The first calibration may not necessarily include entry of the vehicle registration identification (VRN and Member State), when it is not known by the approved workshop having to undertake this calibration. In these circumstances, it shall be possible, for the vehicle owner, and at this time only, to enter the VRN and the Member State using his company card prior to using the vehicle in scope of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 (e.g by using commands through an appropriate menu structure of the vehicle unit&#39;s man-machine interface). Any update or confirmation of this entry shall only be possible using a workshop card.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(393) The installation of an external GNSS facility requires the coupling with the vehicle unit and the subsequent verification of the GNSS position information.</p>
<p>(394) The recording equipment must be positioned in the vehicle in such a way as to allow the driver to access the necessary functions from his seat.</p>

<p>8.   <strong>TYPE-APPROVAL OF RECORDING EQUIPMENT AND TACHOGRAPH CARDS</strong>
         </p>
<p>8.1   <strong>General points</strong>
         </p>
<p>▼M1</p>
<p>For the purpose of this chapter, the words ‘recording equipment’ mean ‘recording equipment or its components’. No type approval is required for the cable(s) linking the motion sensor to the VU, the external GNSS facility to the VU or the external remote communication facility to the VU. The paper, for use by the recording equipment, shall be considered as a component of the recording equipment.</p>
<p>Any manufacturer may ask for type approval of recording equipment component(s) with any other recording equipment component(s), provided each component complies with the requirements of this annex. Alternately, manufacturers may also ask for type approval of recording equipment.</p>
<p>As described in definition (10) in Article 2 of this Regulation, vehicle units have variants in components assembly. Whatever the vehicle unit components assembly, the external antenna and (if applicable) the antenna splitter connected to the GNSS receiver or to the remote communication facility are not part of the vehicle unit type approval.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, manufacturers having obtained type approval for recording equipment shall maintain a publicly available list of compatible antennas and splitters with each type approved vehicle unit, external GNSS facility and external remote communication facility.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(425) Recording equipment shall be submitted for approval complete with any integrated additional devices.</p>
<p>(426) Type approval of recording equipment and of tachograph cards shall include security related tests, functional tests and interoperability tests. Positive results to each of these tests are stated by an appropriate certificate.</p>
<p>▼M1</p>
<p>(427) Member States type approval authorities will not grant a type approval certificate as long as they do not hold:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>a security certificate (if requested by this Annex),</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>a functional certificate,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>and an interoperability certificate (if requested by this Annex)</dd></dl>


<p>for the recording equipment or the tachograph card, subject of the request for type approval.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(428) Any modification in software or hardware of the equipment or in the nature of materials used for its manufacture shall, before being used, be notified to the authority which granted type-approval for the equipment. This authority shall confirm to the manufacturer the extension of the type approval, or may require an update or a confirmation of the relevant functional, security and/or interoperability certificates.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(429) Procedures to update in-situ recording equipment software shall be approved by the authority which granted type approval for the recording equipment. Software update must not alter nor delete any driver activity data stored in the recording equipment. Software may be updated only under the responsibility of the equipment manufacturer.</p>
<p>(430) Type approval of software modifications aimed to update a previously type approved recording equipment may not be refused if such modifications only apply to functions not specified in this Annex. Software update of a recording equipment may exclude the introduction of new character sets, if not technically feasible.</p>
<p>▼B</p>

<p>(435) Manufacturers shall provide the relevant samples of type approval candidate products and associated documentation required by laboratories appointed to perform functional tests, and within one month of the request being made. Any costs resulting from this request shall be borne by the requesting entity. Laboratories shall treat all commercially sensitive information in confidence.</p>
<p>(436) A functional certificate shall be delivered to the manufacturer only after all functional tests specified in Appendix 9, at least, have been successfully passed.</p>
<p>(437) The type approval authority delivers the functional certificate. This certificate shall indicate, in addition to the name of its beneficiary and the identification of the model, a detailed list of the tests performed and the results obtained.</p>
<p>(438) The functional certificate of any recording equipment component shall also indicate the type approval numbers of the other type approved compatible recording equipment components tested for its certification.</p>
<p>(439) The functional certificate of any recording equipment component shall also indicate the ISO or CEN standard against which the functional interface has been certified.</p>
<p>8.4   <strong>Interoperability certificate</strong>
         </p>
<p>(440) Interoperability tests are carried out by a single laboratory under the authority and responsibility of the European Commission.</p>
<p>(441) The laboratory shall register interoperability test requests introduced by manufacturers in the chronological order of their arrival.</p>
<p>(442) Requests will be officially registered only when the laboratory is in possession of:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>the entire set of material and documents necessary for such interoperability tests,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the corresponding security certificate,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the corresponding functional certificate,</dd></dl>


<p>The date of the registration of the request shall be notified to the manufacturer.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(443) No interoperability tests shall be carried out by the laboratory, for recording equipment or tachograph cards that have not passed the vulnerability analysis of their security evaluation and a functional evaluation, except in the exceptional circumstances described in requirement 432.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(444) Any manufacturer requesting interoperability tests shall commit to leave to the laboratory in charge of these tests the entire set of material and documents which he provided to carry out the tests.</p>
<p>(445) The interoperability tests shall be carried out, in accordance with the provisions of Appendix 9 of this Annex, with respectively all the types of recording equipment or tachograph cards:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>for which type approval is still valid or,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>for which type approval is pending and that have a valid interoperability certificate.</dd></dl>

<p>(446) The interoperability tests shall cover all generations of recording equipment or tachograph cards still in use.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>(447) The interoperability certificate shall be issued by the laboratory to the manufacturer only after all required interoperability tests have been successfully passed and after the manufacturer has shown that both a valid functional certificate and a valid security certificate for the product has been granted, except in the exceptional circumstances described in requirement 432.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>(448) If the interoperability tests are not successful with one or more of the recording equipment or tachograph card(s), the interoperability certificate shall not be delivered, until the requesting manufacturer has realised the necessary modifications and has succeeded the interoperability tests. The laboratory shall identify the cause of the problem with the help of the manufacturers concerned by this interoperability fault and shall attempt to help the requesting manufacturer in finding a technical solution. In the case where the manufacturer has modified its product, it is the manufacturer&#39;s responsibility to ascertain from the relevant authorities that the security certificate and the functional certificates are still valid.</p>
<p>(449) The interoperability certificate is valid for six months. It is revoked at the end of this period if the manufacturer has not received a corresponding type approval certificate. It is forwarded by the manufacturer to the type approval authority of the Member State who has delivered the functional certificate.</p>
<p>(450) Any element that could be at the origin of an interoperability fault shall not be used for profit or to lead to a dominant position.</p>
<p>8.5   <strong>Type-approval certificate</strong>
         </p>
<p>(451) The type approval authority of the Member State may deliver the type approval certificate as soon as it holds the three required certificates.</p>
<p>(452) The type approval certificate of any recording equipment component shall also indicate the type approval numbers of the other type approved interoperable recording equipment.</p>
<p>(453) The type approval certificate shall be copied by the type approval authority to the laboratory in charge of the interoperability tests at the time of deliverance to the manufacturer.</p>
<p>(454) The laboratory competent for interoperability tests shall run a public web site on which will be updated the list of recording equipment or tachograph cards models:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>for which a request for interoperability tests have been registered,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>having received an interoperability certificate (even provisional),</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>having received a type approval certificate.</dd></dl>


<p>8.6   <strong>Exceptional procedure: first interoperability certificates for 2nd generation recording equipment and tachograph cards</strong>
         </p>
<p>(455) Until four months after a first couple of 2<sup>nd</sup> generation recording equipment and 2<sup>nd</sup> generation tachograph cards (driver, workshop, control and company cards) have been certified to be interoperable, any interoperability certificate delivered (including the first ones), regarding requests registered during this period, shall be considered provisional.</p>
<p>(456) If at the end of this period, all products concerned are mutually interoperable, all corresponding interoperability certificates shall become definitive.</p>
<p>(457) If during this period, interoperability faults are found, the laboratory in charge of interoperability tests shall identify the causes of the problems with the help of all manufacturers involved and shall invite them to realize the necessary modifications.</p>
<p>(458) If at the end of this period, interoperability problems still remain, the laboratory in charge of interoperability tests, with the collaboration of the manufacturers concerned and with the type approval authorities who delivered the corresponding functional certificates shall find out the causes of the interoperability faults and establish which modifications should be made by each of the manufacturers concerned. The search for technical solutions shall last for a maximum of two months, after which, if no common solution is found, the Commission, after having consulted the laboratory in charge of interoperability tests, shall decide which equipment(s) and cards get a definitive interoperability certificate and state the reasons why.</p>
<p>(459) Any request for interoperability tests, registered by the laboratory between the end of the four month period after the first provisional interoperability certificate has been delivered and the date of the decision by the Commission referred to in requirement 455, shall be postponed until the initial interoperability problems have been solved. Those requests are then processed in the chronological order of their registration.</p>
