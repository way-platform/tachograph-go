#### 1. INTRODUCTION

This appendix specifies data formats, data elements, and data structures for use within the recording equipment and tachograph cards.

#### 1.1. **Approach for definitions of data types**

This appendix uses Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) to define data types. This enables simple and structured data to be defined without implying any specific transfer syntax (encoding rules) which will be application and environment dependent.

ASN.1 type naming conventions are done in accordance with ISO/IEC 8824-1. This implies that:

- where possible, the meaning of the data type is implied through the names being selected,
- where a data type is a composition of other data types, the data type name is still a single sequence of alphabetical characters commencing with a capital letter, however capitals are used within the name to impart the corresponding meaning,
- in general, the data types names are related to the name of the data types from which they are constructed, the equipment in which data is stored and the function related to the data.

If an ASN.1 type is already defined as part of another standard and if it is relevant for usage in the recording equipment, then this ASN.1 type will be defined in this appendix.

To enable several types of encoding rules, some ASN.1 types in this appendix are constrained by value range identifiers. The value range identifiers are defined in paragraph 3 and Appendix 2.

#### 2. DATA TYPE DEFINITIONS

## **▼M3**

For any of the following data types, the default value for an 'unknown' or a 'not applicable' content will consist in filling the data element with Hex 'FF' bytes, unless otherwise specified.

All data types are used for Generation 1 and Generation 2 applications unless otherwise specified. Data types only used for Generation 2, version 2 applications are indicated.

For card data types used for Generation 1 and Generation 2 applications, the size specified in this Appendix is the one for Generation 2 application. The size for Generation 1 application is supposed to be already known by the reader. The Annex IC requirement numbers related to such data types cover both Generation 1 and Generation 2 applications.

Card data types not defined for Generation 1 cards are not stored in Generation 1 application of Generation 2 cards. In particular:

- Type approval numbers stored in Generation 1 application of Generation 2 cards are truncated to the 8 first characters where needed,
- Only the 'FERRY / TRAIN CROSSING begin' of a 'FERRY / TRAIN CROSSING' specific condition is stored in Generation 1 application of Generation 2 cards.

### 2.1. **ActivityChangeInfo**

This data type enables to code, within a two bytes word, a slot status at 00:00 and/or a driver status at 00:00 and/or changes of activity and/or changes of driving status and/or changes of card status for a driver or a co-driver. This data type is related to Annex 1C requirements 105, 266, 291, 320, 321, 343, and 344.

### 5. ENCODING

When encoded with ASN.1 encoding rules, all data types defined shall be encoded according to ISO/IEC 8825-2, aligned variant.

### 6. OBJECT IDENTIFIERS UND APPLICATION IDENTIFIERS

### 6.1. **Object Identifiers**

The Object Identifiers (OIDs) listed in this chapter are only relevant for generation 2. These OIDs are specified in TR-03110-3 and repeated here

for the sake of completeness. These OIDs are contained in the subtree of bsi-de:

#### **VU Authentication protocol identifiers**

id-TA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {bsi-de protocols(2) smartcard(2) 2}
id-TA-ECDSA OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-TA 2}
id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-256 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-TA-ECDSA 3}
id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-384 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-TA-ECDSA 4}
id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-512 OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-TA-ECDSA 5}

*Example:* Suppose VU Authentication is to be done with SHA-384, then the object identifier to use is (in ASN.1 notation) . The value of this object identifier in dot notation is .

|                     | Dot notation            | Byte notation                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-256 | 0.4.0.127.0.7.2.2.2.2.3 | '04 00 7F 00 07 02 02 02 02 03' |
| id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-384 | 0.4.0.127.0.7.2.2.2.2.4 | '04 00 7F 00 07 02 02 02 02 04' |
| id-TA-ECDSA-SHA-512 | 0.4.0.127.0.7.2.2.2.2.5 | '04 00 7F 00 07 02 02 02 02 05' |

#### **Chip Authentication protocol identifiers**

| id-CA                       | OBJECT IDENTIFIER | ::= {bsi-de protocols(2) smartcard(2) 3} |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| id-CA-ECDH                  | OBJECT IDENTIFIER | ::= {id-CA 2}                            |
| id-CA-ECDH-AES-CBC-CMAC-128 | OBJECT IDENTIFIER | ::= {id-CA-ECDH 2}                       |
| id-CA-ECDH-AES-CBC-CMAC-192 | OBJECT IDENTIFIER | ::= {id-CA-ECDH 3}                       |
| id-CA-ECDH-AES-CBC-CMAC-256 | OBJECT IDENTIFIER | ::= {id-CA-ECDH 4}                       |

*Example:* Suppose Chip Authentication is to be done by using the ECDH algorithm, resulting in an AES session key length of 128 bits. This session key will subsequently be used in the CBC mode of operation to ensure data confidentiality and with the CMAC algorithm to ensure data authenticity. Therefore, the object identifier to use is (in ASN.1 notation) . The value of this object identifier in dot notation is .

|                             | Dot notation            | Byte notation                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| id-CA-ECDH-AES-CBC-CMAC-128 | 0.4.0.127.0.7.2.2.3.2.2 | '04 00 7F 00 07 02 02 03 02 02' |
| id-CA-ECDH-AES-CBC-CMAC-192 | 0.4.0.127.0.7.2.2.3.2.3 | '04 00 7F 00 07 02 02 03 02 03' |
| id-CA-ECDH-AES-CBC-CMAC-256 | 0.4.0.127.0.7.2.2.3.2.4 | '04 00 7F 00 07 02 02 03 02 04' |

### 6.2. **Application Identifiers**

Generation 2:

The Application Identifier (AID) for the External GNSS Facility (Generation 2) is given by 'FF 44 54 45 47 4D'. This is a proprietary AID according to ISO/IEC 7816-4.

*Note:* The last 5 bytes encode DTEGM for smart Tachograph External GNSS Facility.

The Application Identifier for the generation 2 tachograph card application is given by 'FF 53 4D 52 44 54'. This is a proprietary AID according to ISO/IEC 7816-4.
