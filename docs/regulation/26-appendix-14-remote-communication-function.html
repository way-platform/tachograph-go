<p>1.   <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
            </p>
<p>This Appendix specifies the design and the procedures to follow in order to perform the remote communication function (the Communication) as required in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 (the Regulation).</p>
<p>DSC_1 Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 determines that the tachograph shall be equipped with a remote communication functionality that shall enable agents of the competent control authorities to read tachograph information from passing vehicles by using remote interrogation equipment (the Remote early detection communication reader [REDCR]), specifically, interrogation equipment connecting wirelessly using CEN 5.8 GHz Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) interfaces.</p>
<p>It is important to comprehend that this functionality is intended to serve only as a pre-filter in order to select vehicles for closer inspection, and it does not replace the formal inspection process as determined in the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014. See recital 9 in the preamble of this regulation, stating that remote communication between the tachograph and control authorities for roadside control purposes facilitates targeted roadside checks.</p>
<p>DSC_2 
                  <em>The Data</em> shall be exchanged using <em>the Communication</em> which shall be a wireless intercourse using 5.8 GHz DSRC wireless communications consistent with this Appendix and tested against the appropriate parameters of EN 300 674-1, {Electromagnetic compatibility and Radio spectrum Matters (ERM); Road Transport and Traffic Telematics (RTTT); Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) transmission equipment (500 kbit/s / 250 kbit/s) operating in the 5,8 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band; Part 1: General characteristics and test methods for Road Side Units (RSU) and On -Board Units (OBU)}.</p>
<p>DSC_3 
                  <em>The Communication</em> shall be established with the communications equipment only when so requested by the equipment of the competent control authority using compliant radio-communication means (<em>the Remote early detection communication reader (REDCR)</em>).</p>
<p>DSC_4 
                  <em>The Data</em> shall be secured to ensure integrity.</p>
<p>DSC_5 Access to <em>the Data</em> communicated shall be restricted to competent control authorities authorised to check infringements of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 and of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 and to workshops in so far as it is necessary to verify the correct functioning of the tachograph.</p>
<p>DSC_6 
                  <em>The Data</em> exchanged during <em>the Communication</em> shall be limited to the data necessary for the purpose of targeting roadside checks of vehicles with a potentially manipulated or misused tachograph.</p>
<p>DSC_7 Data integrity and security shall be obtained by securing <em>the Data</em> within the Vehicle Unit (VU) and by passing only the secured payload data and security related data (see 5.4.4) across the wireless 5.8 GHz DSRC remote communication medium, meaning that only authorised persons of competent control authorities have the means to understand the data passed across <em>the Communication</em> and to verify its authenticity. See Appendix 11 Common Security Mechanisms.</p>
<p>DSC_8 
                  <em>The Data</em> shall contain a timestamp for the time of its last update.</p>
<p>DSC_9 The content of the security data shall be known only to and within the control of the competent control authorities, and those parties with whom they share this information and is outwith the provisions of <em>the Communication</em> that is the subject of this Appendix, save that <em>the Communication</em> makes provision to transfer a packet of security data with every packet of payload data.</p>
<p>DSC_10 The same architecture and equipment shall be capable be used to acquire other data concepts (such as weigh–on-board) using the architecture specified herein.</p>
<p>DSC_11 For clarification, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 (Article 7), data concerning the identity of the driver shall not be communicated across <em>the Communication</em>.</p>
<p>2.   <strong>SCOPE</strong>
            </p>
<p>The scope of this Appendix is to specify how agents of the competent control authorities use a specified 5.8 GHz DSRC wireless communication to remotely obtain data (<em>the Data</em>) from a targeted vehicle that identifies that the targeted vehicle is in potential violation of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 and should be targeted for consideration to be stopped for further investigation.</p>
<p>Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 requires that the Data collected shall be limited to data or pertaining to data that identifies a potential infringement, as defined in Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014.</p>
<p>▼M1</p>
<p>In this scenario, the time available for communication is limited, because <em>the Communication</em> is targeted and of a short- range design. Further, the same communication means for remote tachograph monitoring (RTM) may also be used by the competent control authorities for other applications (such as the maximal weights and dimensions for heavy goods vehicles defined in Directive (EU) 2015/719) and such operations may be separate or sequential at the discretion of the competent control authorities.</p>

<p>General overview of communication Profile 1</p>
<p>This profile covers the use case where an agent of the competent control authorities, uses a short range remote communication Remote Early Detection Communication Reader (5.8 GHz DSRC interfaces operating within ERC 70-03, and tested against the appropriate parameters of EN 300 674-1 as described in section 5) (<em>the REDCR</em>) to remotely identify a vehicle which is potentially in violation of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014. Once identified, the agent of the competent control authorities who is controlling the interrogation decides whether the vehicle should be stopped.</p>

<p>5.   <strong>REMOTE COMMUNICATION DESIGN AND PROTOCOLS</strong>
            </p>
<p>5.1   <strong>Design</strong>
            </p>
<p>The design of the remote communication function in the Smart Tachograph is shown as described in Figure 14.3.</p>
<p>
               <em>Figure 14.3</em>
            </p>
<p>
               <strong>Design of the remote communication function</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_19 The following functions are located in the VU:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>Security Module (VUSM). This function present in the VU is responsible for securing the Data which is to be transmitted from the DSRC-VU to the agent of the competent control authorities via remote communication.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>The secured data is stored in the VUSM memory. At intervals determined in 4.1.1.1 (DSC_12), the VU encrypts and replenishes the RTMdata concept (which comprises payload data and security data concept values determined below in this Appendix) held in the memory of the DSRC-VU. The operation of the security module is defined in Appendix 11 Common Security Mechanisms and outwith the scope of this Appendix, save that it shall be required to provide updates to the VU Communication facility each time the VUSM data changes.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>The communication between the VU and the DSRC-VU may be a wired communication or a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, and the physical location of the DSRC-VU may be integral with the antenna on the windshield of the vehicle, may be internal to the VU, or located somewhere between.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>The DSRC-VU shall have a reliable source of power available at all times. The means by which it is provided with its power is a design decision.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>The memory of the DSRC-VU shall be non-volatile in order to maintain the Data in the DSRC-VU even when the vehicle ignition is switched off.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>If the communication between the VU and the DSRC-VU is made via BLE and the power source is a non-recharging battery, the power source of the DSRC-VU shall be replaced at every Periodic Inspection, and the manufacturer of the DSRC-VU equipment shall be responsible to ensure that the power supply is adequate to last from one Periodic Inspection to the next Periodic Inspection, maintaining normal access to the data by an REDCR throughout the period without failure or interruption.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>VU RTM ‘payload memory’ facility (VUPM). This function present in the VU is responsible for providing and updating the Data. The content of The Data. (‘TachographPayload’) is defined in 5.4.4/5.4.5 below and is updated at the interval determined in 4.1.1.1 (DSC_12).</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>DSRC-VU. This is the function, within or connected to the antenna and in communication with the VU through a wired or wireless (BLE) connection, which holds the current data (VUPM-data) and manages the response to an interrogation across the 5.8 GHz DSRC medium. Disconnection of the DSRC facility or interference during normal vehicle operation with the functioning of the DSRC facility shall be construed as a violation of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>Security module (REDCR) (SM-REDCR) is the function used to decrypt and check integrity of the data originating from the VU. The means by which this is achieved is determined in Appendix 11 Common Security Mechanisms, and is not defined in this Appendix.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>The DSRC facility (REDCR) (DSRC-REDCR) function comprises a 5.8 GHz transceiver and associated firmware and software which manages the Communication with the DSRC-VU according to this Appendix.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>The DSRC-REDCR interrogates the DSRC-VU of the targeted vehicle and obtains the Data (the targeted vehicle&#39;s current VUPM-data) via the DSRC link and processes and stores the received data in its SM-REDCR.</dd></dl>










<p>▼M1</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>The DSRC-VU antenna shall be positioned at a location where it optimizes the DSRC communication between the vehicle and the roadside reader antenna, when the reader is installed 15 meters distance in front of the vehicle and 2 meters height, targeting the horizontal and vertical centre of the windscreen. For light vehicles an installation corresponding to the upper part of the windscreen is suitable. For all the other vehicles the DSRC antenna shall be installed either near the lower or near the upper part of the windscreen.</dd></dl>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>DSC_20 The Antenna and The Communication shall operate within ERC 70-03, tested against the appropriate parameters of EN 300 674-1 as described in section 5. The Antenna and the Communication can implement mitigation techniques against the risk of wireless interference as described in ECC report 228 using e.g., filters in the CEN DSRC 5.8 GHz communication.</p>
<p>DSC_21 The DSRC antenna shall be connected to the DSRC-VU facility either directly within the module mounted to or close to the windshield, or through a dedicated cable constructed in a manner to make illegal disconnection difficult. Disconnection of or interference with the functioning of Antenna shall be a violation of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014. Deliberate masking or otherwise detrimentally affecting the operational performance of the Antenna shall be construed as a violation of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014.</p>
<p>DSC_22

                   The form factor of the antenna is not defined and shall be a commercial decision, so long as the fitted DSRC-VU meets the conformance requirements defined in section 5 below. The antenna shall be positioned as determined in DSC_19 and efficiently support the use cases described in in 4.1.2 and 4.1.3.<strong>◄</strong>

            </p>
<p>The form factor of <em>the REDCR</em> and its antenna may vary according to the circumstances of the reader (tripod mounted, hand held, vehicle mounted, etc.) and the modus operandi employed by the agent of the competent control authorities.</p>
<p>A display and/or notification function is used to present the results of the remote communication function to the agent of the competent control authorities. A display may be provided on a screen, as a printed output, an audio signal, or a combination of such notifications. The form of such display and/or notification is a matter of the requirements of the agents of the competent control authorities and equipment design and is not specified within this Appendix.</p>
<p>DSC_23 The design and form factor of the <em>REDCR</em> shall be a function of commercial design, operating within ERC 70-03, and the design and performance specifications defined in this Appendix, (section 5.3.2), thus providing the marketplace maximum flexibility to design and provide equipment to cover the specific interrogation scenarios of any particular competent control authority.</p>
<p>DSC_24 The design and form factor of the <em>DSRC-VU</em> and its positioning inside or outside the VU shall be a function of commercial design, operating within ERC 70-03 and the design and performance specifications defined in this Appendix (section 5.3.2) and within this Clause (5.1).</p>
<p>DSC_25 However, the <em>DSRC-VU</em> shall be reasonably capable to accept data concept values from other intelligent vehicle equipment by means of an open industry standard connection and protocols. (For example from weigh on board equipment), so long as such data concepts are identified by unique and known application identifiers/file names, and the instructions to operate such protocols shall be made available to the European Commission, and available without charge to manufacturers of relevant equipment.</p>
<p>5.2   <strong>Workflow</strong>
            </p>
<p>5.2.1   <strong>Operations</strong>
            </p>
<p>The workflow of operations is represented in Figure 14.5.</p>

            </p>
<p>
               <strong>Workflow for remote communication function</strong>
            </p>
<p>The steps are described below:</p>
<dl><dt>a.</dt><dd>Whenever the vehicle is in operation (ignition ON) the tachograph is providing data to the VU function. The VU function prepares the Data for the remote communication function (encrypted) and updates the VUPM held in the memory of the DSRC-VU (as defined in 4.1.1.1 — 4.1.1.2). The Data collected shall be formatted as determined in 5.4.4 — 5.4.5 below.</dd><dt>b.</dt><dd>On every occasion that the Data is updated, the timestamp defined in the security data concept shall be updated.</dd><dt>c.</dt><dd>The VUSM function secures the data in accordance with the procedures determined in Appendix 11.</dd><dt>d.</dt><dd>On every occasion that the Data is updated (see 4.1.1.1 — 4.1.1.2), the Data shall be transferred to the DSRC-VU, where it replaces any previous data, in order that updated current data (the Data) shall always be available to be provided in the event of an interrogation by an REDCR. When supplied by the VU to the DSRC-VU the Data shall be identifiable by the filename RTMData or by ApplicationID and Attribute identifiers.</dd><dt>e.</dt><dd>If an agent of the competent control authorities wishes to target a vehicle and collect the Data from the targeted vehicle, the agent of the competent control authorities shall first insert his/her smartcard in the REDCR to enable the Communication and to allow the SM-REDCR to verify its authenticity and decrypt the data.</dd><dt>f.</dt><dd>The agent of the competent control authority then targets a vehicle and requests the data through remote communication. The REDCR opens a 5.8 GHz DSRC interface session with the DSRC-VU of the targeted vehicle, and requests the Data. The Data is transferred to the REDCR through the wireless communication system as a DSRC Attribute using the Application service GET as defined in 5.4. The Attribute contains the encrypted payload data values and the DSRC security data.</dd><dt>g.</dt><dd>The data is analyzed by the REDCR equipment and provided to the agent of the competent control authority.</dd><dt>h.</dt><dd>The agent of the competent control authority uses the data to assist in a decision of whether or not to stop for a detailed inspection, or ask another agent of the competent control authority to stop the vehicle.</dd></dl>







<p>5.2.2   <strong>Interpretation of the Data received via the DSRC communication</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_26 Data received across the 5.8 GHz interface shall carry the meaning and import defined in 5.4.4 and 5.4.5 below and only that meaning and import, and shall be understood within the objectives defined therein. In accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014, <em>the Data</em> shall be used only to provide relevant information to a competent control authority to assist them to determine which vehicle should be stopped for physical inspection, and shall be subsequently destroyed in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 165/2014.</p>

            </p>
<p>DSC_27 The remote interrogation of vehicles using a 5.8GHz DSRC interface should not be used within 200 metres of an operational 5.8 GHz DSRC gantry.</p>
<p>5.3.2   <strong>Downlink and uplink parameters</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_28 The equipment used for remote tachograph monitoring shall conform to and operate within ERC70-03 and the parameters defined in Tables 14.1 and 14.2 below.</p>

<p>DSC_32 The VU antenna shall be fixed to, or close to, the front windshield of the vehicle as specified in 5.1 above.</p>
<p>DSC_33 In the test environment in a workshop (see section 6.3), a DSRC-VU antenna, affixed according to 5.1 above, shall successfully connect with a standard test communication and successfully provide an RTM transaction as defined within this Appendix, at a distance between 2 and 10 meters, better than 99 % of the time, averaged over 1 000 read interrogations.</p>

<p>DSC_34 The transaction protocol to download <em>the Data</em> across the 5.8 GHz DSRC interface link shall be according to the following steps. This section describes a transaction flow under ideal conditions without retransmissions or communication interrupts.</p>
<p>NOTE The purpose of the initialisation phase (Step 1) is to set up the communication between the <em>REDCR</em> and DSRC-VUs that have entered the 5.8 GHz DSRC (master-slave) transaction zone but have not yet established communication with the <em>REDCR</em>, and to notify the application processes.</p>

The DSRC-VU evaluates the received BST, and shall respond (see below) with the list of the supported applications within the Freight&amp;Fleet domain, or shall not respond if none are supported.

<p>DSC_37 The semantic structure of <em>the Data</em> when passed across the 5.8 GHz DSRC interface shall be consistent with what described in this Appendix. The way these data are structured is specified in this clause.</p>
<p>DSC_38 The payload (RTM data) consists of the concatenation of</p>
<dl><dt>1.</dt><dd>EncryptedTachographPayload data, which is the encryption of the TachographPayload defined in ASN.1 in section 5.4.5. The method of encryption is described in Appendix 11</dd><dt>2.</dt><dd>DSRCSecurityData, specified in Appendix 11.</dd></dl>

<p>DSC_39 The RTM Data is being addressed as RTM Attribute=1 and is transferred in the RTM container = 10.</p>
<p>DSC_40 The RTM Context Mark shall identify the supported standard part in the TARV series of standards (RTM corresponds to Part 9)</p>
<p>The ASN.1 module definition for the DSRC data within the RTM application is defined as follows:</p>
<p>►(1)(2) M1   ►(3) M3</p>
<p>5.4.5   <strong>Elements of RtmData, actions performed and definitions</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_41 The data values to be calculated by the VU and used to update the secured data in the DSRC-VU shall be calculated according to the rules defined in Table 14.3:</p>

<p>DSC_48 The <em>DSRC-VU</em> shall support the ‘Freight and Fleet’ application, identified by the Application Identifier ‘2’. Other Application Identifiers may be supported, but shall not be present in this VST, as the BST only requires AID=2. The ‘Applications’ field contains a list of the supported application instances in the <em>DSRC-VU</em>. For each supported application instantiation, a reference to the appropriate standard is given, made of an Rtm Context mark, which is composed of an OBJECT IDENTIFIER representing the related standard, its part (9 for RTM) and possibly its version, plus an EID that is generated by the DSRC-VU, and associated to that application instance.</p>
<p>A practical example of the settings specified in Table 14.8, with an indication of bit encodings, is given in Table 14.9.</p>

<p>5.4.8   <strong>DSRC Test transaction description</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_53 Full tests that include securing the data, need to be carried out as defined in Appendix 11 Common Security Mechanisms, by authorised persons with access to security procedures, using the normal GET command as defined above.</p>
<p>DSC_54 Commissioning and periodic inspection tests that require decrypting and comprehension of the decrypted data content shall be undertaken as specified in Appendix 11 Common Security Mechanisms and Appendix 9, Type Approval List of Minimum required tests.</p>
<p>However, the basic DSRC communication can be tested by the command ECHO. Such tests may be required on commissioning, at periodic inspection, or otherwise to the requirement of the competent control authority or Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 (See 6 below)</p>
<p>DSC_55 In order to effect this basic communication test, the ECHO command is issued by the REDCR during a session, i.e., after an initialisation phase has been completed successfully. The sequence of interactions is thus similar to that of an interrogation:</p>

<p>5.6.2   <strong>Application Protocol</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_71 The application protocol between the VU Remote Communication facility and DSRC-VU is responsible for periodically transferring the remote communication data from the VU to the DSRC.</p>
<p>DSC_72 The following main commands are identified:</p>
<dl><dt>1.</dt><dd>Initialisation of the communication link — Request</dd><dt>2.</dt><dd>Initialisation of the communication link — Response</dd><dt>3.</dt><dd>Send Data with Identifier of the RTM application and Payload defined by RTM Data</dd><dt>4.</dt><dd>Acknowledgment of the data</dd><dt>5.</dt><dd>Termination of the communication link — Request</dd><dt>6.</dt><dd>Termination of the communication link — Response</dd></dl>





<p>DSC_73 In ASN1.0, the previous commands may be defined as:</p>

<p>DSC_74 The description of the commands and parameters is following:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>is used to initialize the communication link. The command is sent by the VU to the DSRC-VU. The LinkIdentifier is set by the VU and communicated to the DSRC-VU to track a specific communication link. (Note: this is to support future links and other application/modules like Weighing on board).</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>is used by the DSRC-VU to provide the response of the request to initialize the communication link. The command is sent by the DSRC-VU to the VU. The command provides the result of the initialisation as answer = 1 (Success) or =0 (Failure).</dd></dl>

<p>DSC_75 The initialization of the communication link shall be done only after installation, calibration, and start of the engine/VU is switched on.</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>is used to by the VU to send the signed RCDTData (i.e., the remote communication Data) to the DSRC-VU. The data will be sent every 60 seconds. The DataTransactionId parameter identifies the specific transmission of data. The LinkIdentifier is also used to ensure that the appropriate link is correct.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>is sent by the DSRC-VU to provide the feedback to the VU on the reception of the data from a command identified by the DataTransactionId parameter. The Answer parameter is 1 (Success) or =0 (Failure). If a VU receives more than three answers equal to 0 or if the VU does not receive a RCDT Data Acknowledgment for a specific previously sent RCDT- Send Data with a specific DataTransactionId, the VU will generate and record an event.</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>is sent by the VU to DSRC-VU to terminate a link for a specific LinkIdentifier.</dd></dl>


<p>DSC_76 At the restart of the DSRC-VU or a VU, all the existing Communication Links should be removed as there could be ‘dangling’ Links due to the sudden shutdown of a VU.</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>is sent by the DSRC-VU to the VU to confirm the request of termination of the link by the VU for the specific LinkIdentifier.</dd></dl>
<p>5.7   <strong>Error handling</strong>
            </p>
<p>5.7.1   <strong>Recording and communication of the Data in the DSRC-VU</strong>
            </p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>DSC_77 
                  <em>The Data</em> shall be provided, already secured, by the <em>VUSM</em> function to the <em>DSRC-VU</em>. The <em>VUSM</em> shall verify that data recorded in the <em>DSRC-VU</em> has been transmitted successfully to the DSRC-VU. The recording and reporting of any errors in the transfer of data from the <em>VU</em> to the memory of the <em>DSRC-VU</em> shall be recorded with type EventFaultType and enum value set to ‘0C’H Communication error with the remote communication facility event together with the timestamp. The <em>VUSM</em> shall verify that the data has been transmitted successfully to the DSRC-VU.</p>
<p>DSC_78 Reserved for future use.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>DSC_79 If the VUPM attempts to obtain VU data from the security module (to pass to the VU-DSRC), but fails to do so, it shall record that failure with type EventFaultType and enum value set to <em>‘62’H Remote Communication Facility</em>&#39; communication fault together with the timestamp. The failure of the communication is detected when a  message is not received for the related (i.e., with the same DataTransactionId  messages)  for more than three consecutive times.</p>
<p>5.7.2   <strong>Wireless Communication errors</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_80 Communication error handling shall be consistent with the related DSRC standards, namely EN 300 674-1, EN 12253, EN 12795, EN 12834 and the appropriate parameters of EN 13372.</p>
<p>5.7.2.1   <strong>Encryption and signature errors</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_81 Encryption and signature errors shall be handled as defined in Appendix 11 Common Security Mechanisms and are not present in any error messages associated with the DSRC transfer of data.</p>
<p>5.7.2.2   <strong>Recording of errors</strong>
            </p>
<p>The DSRC medium is a dynamic wireless communication in an environment of uncertain atmospheric and interference conditions, particularly in the ‘portable REDCR’ and ‘moving vehicle’ combinations involved in this application. It is therefore necessary to ascertain the difference between a ‘read failure’ and an ‘error’ condition. In a transaction across a wireless interface, read failure is common and the consequence is usually to retry, i.e. rebroadcast the BST and reattempt the sequence, which will in most circumstances lead to a successful communication connection and transfer of data, unless the target vehicle moves out of range during the time required to retransmit. (A ‘successful’ instance of a ‘read’ may have involved several attempts and retries).</p>
<p>Read failure may be because the antennas were not paired properly (failure of ‘aiming’); because one of the antennas is shielded — this may be deliberate, but also can be caused by the physical presence of another vehicle; radio interference, especially from circa 5.8 GHz WIFI or other public access wireless communications, or may be caused by radar interference, or difficult atmospheric conditions (e.g. during a thunderstorm); or simply by moving out of the range of the DSRC communication. Individual instances of read failures, by their nature, cannot be recorded, simply because the communication simply did not occur.</p>
<p>However, if the agent of the competent control authority targets a vehicle and attempts to interrogate its <em>DSRC-VU</em>, but no successful transfer of data ensues, this failure could have occurred because of deliberate tampering, and therefore the agent of the competent control authority needs a means to log the failure, and alert colleagues downstream that there may be a violation. The colleagues can then stop the vehicle and carry out a physical inspection. However, as no successful communication has taken place, the DSRC-VU cannot provide data concerning the failure. Such reporting shall therefore be a function of REDCR equipment design.</p>
<p>‘Failure to read’ is technically different to an ‘error’. In this context an ‘error’ is the acquisition of a wrong value.</p>
<p>Data transferred to the <em>DSRC-VU</em> is supplied already secured, therefore must be verified by the supplier of the data (see 5.4).</p>
<p>Data subsequently transferred across the air interface is checked by cyclic redundancy checks at the communications level. If the CRC validates, then the data is correct. If the CRC does not validate, the data is retransmitted. The probability that data could successfully pass through a CRC incorrectly is statistically so highly improbable that it may be discounted.</p>
<p>If the CRC does not validate and there is no time to retransmit and receive the correct data, then the result will not be an error, but an instantiation of a specific type of read failure.</p>
<p>The only meaningful ‘failure’ data that can be recorded is that of the number of successful initiations of transactions that occur, that do not result in a successful transfer of data to the REDCR.</p>
<p>DSC_82 The <em>REDCR</em> shall therefore record, time-stamped, the number of occasions where the ‘initialisation’ phase of a DSRC interrogation is successful, but the transaction terminated before <em>the Data</em> was successfully retrieved by the REDCR. This data shall be available to agent of the competent control authority and shall be stored in the memory of the REDCR equipment. The means by which this is achieved shall be a matter of product design or the specification of a competent control authority.</p>
<p>The only meaningful ‘error’ data that can be recorded is the number of occasions where the REDCR fails to decrypt <em>the Data</em> received. However, it should be noted that this will only relate to the efficiency of the REDCR software. Data may be technically decrypted, but make no semantic sense.</p>
<p>DSC_83 The <em>REDCR</em> shall therefore record, time-stamped, the number of occasions where it has attempted but failed to decipher data received across the DSRC interface.</p>
<p>6.   <strong>COMMISSIONING AND PERIODIC INSPECTION TESTS FOR THE REMOTE COMMUNICATION FUNCTION</strong>
            </p>
<p>6.1   <strong>General</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_84 Two type of tests are foreseen for the remote communication function:</p>
<dl><dt>1)</dt><dd>An ECHO test to validate the DSRC-REDCR &gt;&gt;-:-<dsrc-vu wireless="" communication="" channel.<="" dd=""></dsrc-vu></dd><dt>2)</dt><dd>A End-to-end security test to ensure that a workshop card is able to access the encrypted and signed data content created by the VU and transmitted over the wireless communication channel.</dd></dl>

<p>6.2   <strong>ECHO</strong>
            </p>
<p>This clause contains provisions specifically made to test only that the <em>DSRC-REDCR</em> &gt;&gt;-:-&lt;<em>DSRC-VU</em> is functionally active.</p>
<p>The objective of the ECHO command is to enable workshops or type approval test facilities to test that the DSRC link is working without needing access to security credentials. The tester&#39;s equipment therefore only needs to be able to initialise a DSRC communication (sending a BST with AID=2) and then send the ECHO command, and, assuming the DSRC is working, will receive the ECHO response. See 5.4.8 for details. Assuming it receives this response correctly, the DSRC link (<em>DSRC-REDCR</em> &gt;&gt;-:-&lt;<em>DSRC-VU</em>) may be validated as functioning correctly.</p>
<p>6.3   <strong>Tests to validate the secure data content</strong>
            </p>
<p>DSC_85 This test is execute to validate the end-to-end security flow of data. A DSRC test reader is needed for such test. The DSRC test reader performs the same functionality and it is implemented with the same specifications of the reader used by the law enforcers, with the difference that a workshop card shall be used to authenticate the user of the DSRC test reader rather than a control card. The test can be executed after the initial activation of a Smart Tachograph or at the end of the calibration procedure. After the activation, the vehicle unit shall generate and communicate to the DSRC-VU the secured early detection data.</p>
<p>DSC_86 The workshop personnel must position the DSRC test reader at a distance between 2 and 10 metres in front of the vehicle.</p>
<p>DSC_87 Then the workshop personnel will insert a workshop card in the DSRC test reader to request the interrogation of the early detection data to the vehicle unit. After a successful interrogation, the workshop personnel will access the received data to ensure that it has been successfully validated for integrity and decrypted.</p>
