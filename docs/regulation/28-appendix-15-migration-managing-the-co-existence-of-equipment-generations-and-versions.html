<p>The introduction of this Annex provides an overview of the transition between the first and the second generation tachograph systems, and of the introduction of the second version of second generation recording equipment and tachograph cards.</p>
<p>In addition to the provisions of this introduction, the following information can be reminded:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>first generation motion sensors are not interoperable with any version of second generation vehicle units,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>only second generation motion sensors can be installed in vehicles equipped with any version of second generation vehicle units,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>data download and calibration equipment need to support use of both generations or versions of recording equipment and tachograph cards.</dd></dl>


<p>2.2.   <strong>Interoperability between VU and cards</strong>
            </p>
<p>It is understood that first generation tachograph cards are interoperable with first generation vehicle units (in compliance with Annex IB of Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85), any version of second generation tachograph cards are interoperable with any version of second generation vehicle units (in compliance with Annex IC of this Regulation). In addition, the requirements below shall apply.</p>
