<p>2.   <strong>GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE ADAPTOR</strong>
            </p>
<p>2.1.   <strong>Adaptor general description</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_001 The adaptor shall provide a connected VU with secured motion data permanently representative of vehicle speed and distance travelled.</p>
<p>The adaptor is only intended for those vehicles that are required to be equipped with recording equipment in compliance with this Regulation.</p>
<p>It shall be installed and used only in those types of vehicle defined in definition yy) ‘adaptor’ of Annex IC where it is not mechanically possible to install any other type of existing motion sensor which is otherwise compliant with the provisions of this Annex and its Appendixes 1 to 16.</p>
<p>The adaptor shall not be mechanically interfaced to a moving part of the vehicle, but connected to the speed/distance impulses which are generated by integrated sensors or alternative interfaces.</p>
<p>ADA_002 A type approved motion sensor (according to the provisions of this Annex IC, section 8, Type approval of recording equipment and tachograph cards) shall be fitted into the adaptor housing, which shall also include a pulse converter device inducing the incoming pulses to the embedded motion sensor. The embedded motion sensor itself shall be connected to the VU, so that the interface between the VU and the adaptor shall be compliant with the requirements set out in ISO16844-3.</p>
<p>2.2.   <strong>Functions</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_003 The adaptor shall include the following functions:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>interfacing and adapting the incoming speed pulses,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>inducing the incoming pulses to the embedded motion sensor,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>all functions of the embedded motion sensor, providing secured motion data to the VU.</dd></dl>


<p>2.3.   <strong>Security</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_004 The adaptor shall not be security certified according to the motion sensor generic security target defined in Appendix 10 of this Annex. Security related requirements specified in section 4.4 of this Appendix shall apply instead.</p>
<p>3.   <strong>REQUIREMENTS FOR THE RECORDING EQUIPMENT WHEN AN ADAPTOR IS INSTALLED</strong>
            </p>
<p>The requirements in the following Chapters indicate how the requirements of this Annex shall be understood when an adaptor is used. The related requirement numbers of Annex IC are provided between brackets.</p>
<p>ADA_005 The recording equipment of any vehicle fitted with an adaptor must comply with all the provisions of this Annex, except otherwise specified in this Appendix.</p>
<p>ADA_006 When an adaptor is installed, the recording equipment includes cables, the adaptor (including a motion sensor), and a VU [01].</p>
<p>ADA_007 The detection of events and/or faults function of the recording equipment is modified as follows:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>the ‘power supply interruption’ event shall be triggered by the VU, while not in calibration mode, in case of any interruption exceeding 200 milliseconds of the power supply of the embedded motion sensor [79]</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the ‘motion data error’ event shall be triggered by the VU in case of interruption of the normal data flow between the embedded motion sensor and the VU and/or in case of data integrity or data authentication error during data exchange between the embedded motion sensor and the VU [83]</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the ‘security breach attempt’ event shall be triggered by the VU for any other event affecting the security of the embedded motion sensor, while not in calibration mode [85]</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the ‘recording equipment’ fault shall be triggered by the VU, while not in calibration mode, for any fault of the embedded motion sensor [88]</dd></dl>



<p>ADA_008 The adaptor faults detectable by the recording equipment shall be those related with the embedded motion sensor [88].</p>
<p>ADA_009 The VU calibration function shall allow to automatically pair the embedded motion sensor with the VU [202, 204].</p>
<p>4.   <strong>CONSTRUCTION AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ADAPTOR</strong>
            </p>
<p>4.1.   <strong>Interfacing and adapting incoming speed pulses</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_011 The adaptor input interface shall accept frequency pulses representative of the vehicle speed and distance travelled. Electrical characteristics of the incoming pulses are: <em>TBD by the manufacturer</em>. Adjustments accessible to only the adaptor manufacturer, and to the approved workshop performing the adaptor installation shall allow the correct interfacing of the adaptor input to the vehicle, if applicable.</p>
<p>▼M3</p>
<p>ADA_012 The adaptor input interface shall be able, if applicable, to multiply or divide the frequency pulses of the incoming speed pulses by a fixed factor, to adapt the signal to the k factor range defined by this Annex (2 400 to 25 000 pulses/km). This fixed factor may only be programmed by the adaptor manufacturer, and the approved workshop performing the adaptor installation.</p>
<p>▼B</p>
<p>4.2.   <strong>Inducing the incoming pulses to the embedded motion sensor</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_013 The incoming pulses, possibly adapted as specified above, shall be induced to the embedded motion sensor, so that each incoming pulse shall be detected by the motion sensor.</p>
<p>4.3.   <strong>Embedded motion sensor</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_014 The embedded motion sensor shall be stimulated by the induced pulses, thus allowing it to generate motion data accurately representing the vehicle movement, as if it was mechanically interfaced to a moving part of the vehicle.</p>
<p>ADA_015 The identification data of the embedded motion sensor shall be used by the VU to identify the adaptor [95].</p>
<p>ADA_016 The installation data stored in the embedded motion sensor shall be considered to represent the adaptor installation data [122].</p>
<p>4.4.   <strong>Security requirements</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_017 The adaptor housing shall be designed so that it cannot be opened. It shall be sealed, so that physical tampering attempts can be easily detected (e.g. through visual inspection, see ADA_035). Seals shall follow the same requirements of motion sensor seals [398 to 406]</p>
<p>ADA_018 It shall not be possible to remove the embedded motion sensor from the adaptor without breaking the seal(s) of the adaptor housing, or breaking the seal between the sensor and the adaptor housing (see ADA_034).</p>
<p>ADA_019 The adaptor shall ensure that motion data may only been processed and derived from the adaptor input.</p>
<p>4.5.   <strong>Performance characteristics</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_020 The adaptor shall be fully operational in the temperature range defined by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>ADA_021 The adaptor shall be fully operational in the humidity range 10 % to 90 % [214].</p>
<p>ADA_022 The adaptor shall be protected against over-voltage, inversion of its power supply polarity, and short circuits [216].</p>
<p>ADA_023 The adaptor shall either:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>react to a magnetic field disturbing vehicle motion detection. In such circumstances, the vehicle unit will record and store a sensor fault [88] or,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>have a sensing element that is protected from, or immune to, magnetic fields [217].</dd></dl>

<p>ADA_024 The adaptor shall conform to international regulation UN ECE R10, related to electromagnetic compatibility, and shall be protected against electrostatic discharges and transients [218].</p>
<p>4.6.   <strong>Materials</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_025 The adaptor shall meet the protection grade (<em>TBD by the manufacturer, depending on the installation position</em>) [220, 221].</p>
<p>ADA_026 The colour of the adaptor housing shall be yellow.</p>
<p>4.7.   <strong>Markings</strong>
            </p>
<p>ADA_027 A descriptive plaque shall be affixed to the adaptor and shall show the following details:</p>
<dl><dt>—</dt><dd>name and address of the manufacturer of the adaptor,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>manufacturer&#39;s part number and year of manufacture of the adaptor,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>approval mark of the adaptor type or of the recording equipment type including the adaptor,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the date on which the adaptor has been installed,</dd><dt>—</dt><dd>the vehicle identification number of the vehicle on which it has been installed.</dd></dl>
