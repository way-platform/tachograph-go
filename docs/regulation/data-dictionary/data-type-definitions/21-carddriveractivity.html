<p class="norm">Information, stored in a driver or a workshop card, related to the activities of the driver (Annex 1C requirements 267, 268, 292, 293, 321 and 344).</p>

               <span class="boldface">activityPointerOldestDayRecord</span> is the specification of the begin of the storage place (number of bytes from the beginning of the string) of the oldest complete day record in the activityDailyRecords string. The maximum value is given by the length of the string.</p>
<p class="norm">
               <span class="boldface">activityPointerNewestRecord</span> is the specification of the begin of the storage place (number of bytes from the beginning of the string) of the most recent day record in the activityDailyRecords string.

<p class="norm">
               <span class="boldface">activityDailyRecords</span> is the space available to store the driver activity data (data structure: CardActivityDailyRecord) for each calendar day where the card has been used.</p>
<p class="norm">
               <span class="boldface">Value assignment</span>: this octet string is cyclically filled with records of CardActivityDailyRecord. At the first use storing is started at the first byte of the string. All new records are appended at the end of the previous one. When the string is full, storing continues at the first byte of the string independently of a break being inside a data element. Before placing new activity data in the string (enlarging current activityDailyRecord, or placing a new activityDailyRecord) that replaces older activity data, activityPointerOldestDayRecord must be updated to reflect the new location of the oldest complete day record, and activityPreviousRecordLength of this (new) oldest complete day record must be reset to 0.</p>
