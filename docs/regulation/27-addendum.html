<p class="list">The VU shall compute the daily driving time, the weekly driving time and the fortnightly driving time using relevant data stored in a driver (or workshop) card inserted in the driver slot (slot 1, card reader #1) of the Vehicle Unit, and selected driver’s activities while this card is inserted in the VU.</p>
<p class="list">The driving times shall not be calculated while no driver (or workshop) card is inserted.</p>
<p class="list">UNKNOWN period(s) found during the time period needed for computations shall be assimilated to BREAK/REST.</p>
<p class="list">UNKNOWN periods and activities of negative duration (i.e. start of the activity occurs later than the end of the activity) due to time overlaps between two different VUs or due to time adjustment, are not taken into account.</p>
