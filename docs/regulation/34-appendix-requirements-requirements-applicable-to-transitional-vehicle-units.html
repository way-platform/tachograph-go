<h1>4.   REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO TRANSITIONAL VEHICLE UNITS: REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO TRANSITIONAL VEHICLE UNITS</h1>
<p>Transitional vehicle units may process the OSNMA signal available during its public test phase, but are not able to report the Navigation Messages Authentication Status from the SIS available during OSNMA operational phase, until an appropriate software update is applied. They therefore assume that the standard positions provided by the GNSS receiver are always authenticated.</p>
<p>The requirements of Annex IC and its Appendixes 1 to 16 apply, with the following interpretations.</p>
<p>
                  <strong>TRA_004</strong>
                   Annex IC, 3.9.15 ‘Time conflict’ event, requirement 86, shall be understood as:</p>
<p>
               <em>This event shall be triggered, while not in calibration mode, when the VU detects a discrepancy between the time of the vehicle unit’s time measurement function and the time originating from the standard positions transmitted by the GNSS receiver or the external GNSS facility. A ‘ time discrepancy’ is detected if the time difference exceeds ± 3 seconds corresponding to the time accuracy set out in requirement 41a, the latter increased by the maximal time drift per day. This event shall be recorded together with the internal clock value of the recording equipment. The VU shall perform the check for triggering the ‘time conflict’ event right before the VU automatically re-adjusts the VU internal clock, in accordance with requirement 211.</em>
