<h1>1.   DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS: DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS</h1>
<p>1.1.   <strong>Definitions</strong>
            </p>
<p>
               <strong>Service Declaration of Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA)</strong> means the declaration of the European Commission that Galileo OSNMA enters its operational phase.</p>
<p>
               <strong>Transitional vehicle unit</strong>: Vehicle unit complying with the provisions of this Appendix.</p>
<p>Transitional vehicle units are constructed in accordance with the SIS ICD and the OSNMA receiver guidelines applicable to the OSNMA public test phase. They contain a GNSS receiver which is capable of using OSNMA available during its public test phase.</p>
<p>Transitional vehicle units are however unable to authenticate the navigation messages available after the Service Declaration of OSNMA, due to a necessary update of the cryptographic material in the vehicle unit. An appropriate software update needs to be applied, so that they can start to use OSNMA, and comply with all the requirements of Annex IC and its Appendixes 1 to 16. Before being updated, transitional vehicle units implement the OSNMA related functionalities as specified in this Appendix. Functionalities unrelated to OSNMA remain unchanged.</p>
<p>If the appropriate software update is applied, transitional vehicle units implement the SIS ICD and the OSNMA receiver guidelines applicable to the OSNMA operational phase, and comply with all the requirements of Annex IC and its Appendixes 1 to 16, using OSNMA available during the operational phase.</p>
<p>
               <strong>Transitional tachograph</strong>: tachograph including a transitional vehicle unit.</p>
