<p class="norm">For the purpose of this chapter, the words ‘recording equipment’ mean ‘recording equipment or its components’. No type approval is required for the cable(s) linking the motion sensor to the VU, the external GNSS facility to the VU or the external remote communication facility to the VU. The paper, for use by the recording equipment, shall be considered as a component of the recording equipment.</p>
<p class="norm">Any manufacturer may ask for type approval of recording equipment component(s) with any other recording equipment component(s), provided each component complies with the requirements of this annex. Alternately, manufacturers may also ask for type approval of recording equipment.</p>
<p class="norm">As described in definition (10) in Article 2 of this Regulation, vehicle units have variants in components assembly. Whatever the vehicle unit components assembly, the external antenna and (if applicable) the antenna splitter connected to the GNSS receiver or to the remote communication facility are not part of the vehicle unit type approval.</p>
<p class="norm">Nevertheless, manufacturers having obtained type approval for recording equipment shall maintain a publicly available list of compatible antennas and splitters with each type approved vehicle unit, external GNSS facility and external remote communication facility.</p>

The search for technical solutions shall last for a maximum of two months, after which, if no common solution is found, the Commission, after having consulted the laboratory in charge of interoperability tests, shall decide which equipment(s) and cards get a definitive interoperability certificate and state the reasons why.</p>

Those requests are then processed in the chronological order of their registration.</p>
