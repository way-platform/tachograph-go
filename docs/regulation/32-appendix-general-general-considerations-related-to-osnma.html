            </p>
<p class="norm">In order to allow vehicles registered for the first time to be fitted with version 2 of second generation tachographs, starting from the requested introduction date as defined in point (ccc) of Section 1 of Annex I C to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/799, there is a need to type-approve, produce and commercialize vehicle units before the Service Declaration of OSNMA. For these vehicle units, referred to as transitional vehicle units, OSNMA-related requirements of Annex IC and its Appendixes 1 to 16 need to be adapted, so that they can be type approved and used in the field.</p>
<p class="norm">The provisions laid down in this Appendix define the specific requirements applicable to transitional vehicle units. They only apply to vehicle units with an internal GNSS receiver.</p>
